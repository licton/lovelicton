Yesterday, SDOT announced 11 more miles of [Stay Healthy Streets](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2020/05/01/get-ready-11-more-miles-of-stay-healthy-streets-coming-your-way/) including one in [Licton Springs.](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/Greenways/NGW/StayHealthyStreets_AuroraLicton_Map.pdf)

[Stay Healthy Streets](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2020/04/16/announcing-stay-healthy-streets/) are part of an initiative by the Mayor and SDOT to give people sufficent space to safely walk, bike, and roll for exercise and essential transportation. 

Stay Healthy Streets are closed to thru-traffic – but not residents or deliveries – 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the duration of the emergency or until otherwise noted by the City of Seattle. People with destinations along Stay Healthy Streets – like residents, essential workers, emergency service providers, delivery providers, and garbage and recycling collectors will continue to have vehicle access.

If you're interested in volunteering to help with the Stay Heatlh Streets initiative, you can email NorthSeattleGreenway@Seattle.gov.
