A neighbor posted on the local [Licton Springs Buy Nothing Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/131617810551046) that there is another [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/) in Licton Springs! 

Take a stroll over to 89th and Meridian to checkout the beautiful blue Little Free Library filled with great books to borrow.
