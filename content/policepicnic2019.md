Hot dogs, ice cream, jazz music, robots, horses, dogs! 

This past Saturday, the Seattle Police department hosted their annual [Precinct Picnic](https://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2019/07/10/its-picnic-time/), at the North Precinct complete with free ice cream and hot dogs, members of the mounted patrol, canine, bomb squad, and an amazing local jazz band. Thank you to the Seattle Police Department for a beautiful day in Licton Springs!
