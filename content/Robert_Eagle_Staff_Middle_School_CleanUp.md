We recieved the below request for volunteers from the [Friends of Robert Eagle Staff Middle School PTSA](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsOfRobertEagleStaffMS/) to help beautify the school grounds at Robert Eagle Staff Middle School. 

<i> "Please join Eagle Staff MS parents and community members to help pull weeds at Eagle Staff, specifically starting in/around the parking lot areas.  Once finished out front, we will move to the west & back sides of the school. Compost bags, gloves, tools, ice cold beverages will be provided.  If you prefer, you are welcome to BYO gloves, weeding tools, hat and a  water bottle.  Many hands make light work and this effort to care for our school grounds will instill pride for students, staff and families at your school, model environmental stewardship and ensures we are a good neighbor in our community.  It will be great to see what we can accomplish together!!!" </i>
