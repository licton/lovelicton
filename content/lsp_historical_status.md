As mentioned [earlier this year](https://lovelicton.com/lictonspringspark-landmark.html), Licton Springs Park was nominated as a historic site. A copy of the nomination is posted on Seattle Department of Neighborhoods website [here](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/HistoricPreservation/Landmarks/CurrentNominations/LPBCurrentNom_Licton_Springs.pdf). 

On October 16, 2019 the Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board approved the designation of Licton Springs Park as an official historic site with final approval expected in early 2020. LoveLicton and the Licton Springs Community Council were pleased to support the proposal and congratulate the First People of the Pacific Northwest and Urban Native Education Alliance. 

This approval marks Seattle's first Indigenous landmark. You can read more about the park and the history in the [Crosscut article from Oct 29th](https://crosscut.com/2019/10/i-know-who-i-am-seattles-urban-natives-tell-story-citys-first-indigenous-landmark).
