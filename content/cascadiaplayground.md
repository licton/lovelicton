We recieved some questions from neighbors about the public hours for the [Cascadia Elementary](https://www.cascadiaes.seattleschools.org/cms/One.aspx) playground. We learned from the Licton Springs Community Council that the playground is expected to be open to the public in the evenings after school lets out (2:30PM) during the week and on weekends. The playground gate can be locked by accident but if it is locked you can call SPS Safety and Security at 206.252.0707. 

As a follow up, we are looking into the public hours for the track. Do you know them? Let us know in the comments!
