The need for a neighborhood community center has received a lot of attention during this election cycle. All of the major candidates running for the District 5 council seat have gone on record in support. The momentum is building, and your voice could help make the community center a reality.

At the recent Celebrate North Seattle event at Oaktree plaza, [ALUV (Aurora-Licton Springs Urban Village)](https://www.facebook.com/AuroraLicton/) asked over 120 people what was most important to them about having a community center. The top 10 answers were:

1. Playground
2. Library
3. Pool
4. Large gathering space
5. Sport Court
6. Childcare
7. Senior Activities
8. After school programs
9. Fitness classes
10. Meeting Rooms

If you support the idea of a neighborhood community center, reach out to your elected representatives, and those running to represent you, and let them know!
