Next time you're walking around the neighborhood, take a stroll down 92nd and 100th between Fremont and Wallingford to see [all sorts of art exhibits](https://artbeat.seattle.gov/2020/10/14/art-interruptions-2020-licton-springs-neighborhood-greenway/). 

We had a chance to check out, "One Time, One Meeting: A Community Shrine‚Äù by [Erin Shigaki](http://www.purplegatedesign.com/). The wooden placards bear words of hope and contemplation by and for the community during the global pandemic.
