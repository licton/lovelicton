In our previous post, we mentioned some community resources to help support you during this unpresedented time including the [COVID-19 Resources from the Office of Mayor Jenny A. Durkan](https://www.seattle.gov/mayor/covid-19) and local community group, [For North Seattle](https://www.facebook.com/groups/fornorthseattle/?ref=br_rs).

We would also like to highlight some ways to give back to support the most vulnerable in our community. 

Licton Springs Community Council would like to invite you to join them in donating to the [Washington Food Fund](https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund) and [Epic Life Church's Support for Covid-Response to our Community](https://epiclifechurch.churchcenter.com/giving). Please note: due to Stay Home order, food banks are asking for donations to be made by credit card or check instead of in-person food drop offs. If you make a donation, please reach out to lictonsprings@hotmail.com to claim your virtual bouquet of flowers to say thank you.

Additionally, Aurora Commons has set up the [COVID-19 Unshelted Community Fund](https://www.auroracommons.org/covid19communityfund) to help our unhoused community shelter in place by providing enough supplies to keep them warm, sheltered, and fed during this crisis.

Do you know of another resource that our community should know about? Email us at [lovelicton@gmail.com](mailto:lovelicton@gmail.com)

Stay safe!
