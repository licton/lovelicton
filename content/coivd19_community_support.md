In our previous post, we mentioned some community resources to help support you during this unpresedented time including the [COVID-19 Resources from the Office of Mayor Jenny A. Durkan](https://www.seattle.gov/mayor/covid-19) and local community group, [For North Seattle](https://www.facebook.com/groups/fornorthseattle/?ref=br_rs).

We would also like to highlight some ways to give back to support the most vulnerable in our community. 

[Licton Springs Community Council](https://lictonsprings.org/) would like to invite you to join them in donating to the [Washington Food Fund](https://philanthropynw.org/wa-food-fund) and [Epic Life Church's Support for Covid-Response to our Community](https://epiclifechurch.churchcenter.com/giving). 

WA Food Fund is a relief fund which comprises of three Washington-based organizations working on the frontlines of food insecurity — [Food Lifeline](https://foodlifeline.org/), [Northwest Harvest](https://www.northwestharvest.org/) and [Second Harvest](https://2-harvest.org/) — who will use these funds to distribute food to hundreds of food banks across the state from our cities to our most rural communities. 

Please note: due to Stay Home order, food banks are asking for donations to be made by credit card or check instead of in-person food drop offs. If you make a donation, please reach out to lictonsprings@hotmail.com to claim your virtual bouquet of flowers to say thank you.

Additionally, Aurora Commons has set up the [COVID-19 Unshelted Community Fund](https://www.auroracommons.org/covid19communityfund) to help our unhoused community shelter in place by providing enough supplies to keep them warm, sheltered, and fed during this crisis.

Finally, [Together Washington: Help Support Family Emergency Kits](https://www.togetherwashington.com/family-emergency-kits) is working with World Vision USA, For North Seattle, and Seattle Parks and Recreation to bring Family Emergency Kits with key essential items to some of the most vulnerable families in North Seattle.
