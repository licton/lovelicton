While, we have written about the need for an Aurora-Licton Urban Village community center [earlier this year](https://lovelicton.com/aluv-community-center.html), we could use your help in letting the city council know about the need for funding of a feasability study in the 2020 budget.  The Licton Springs Community Council voted in support of this initiative.

You can find a sample letter from ALUV [here](http://auroralictonuv.org/2019/10/20/funds-for-a-community-center-feasibility-study/). 

If you support the idea of a neighborhood community center, reach out to your elected representatives, and those running to represent you, and let them know! You can reach the city council at council@seattle.gov. 

Also, if you are available, please attend and voice support at the Budget Hearing on Tuesday, October 22nd starting at 5:30 pm at City Hall (600 4th Ave). Sign in starts at 3:00.
