## Your Voice, Your Choice Prioritization

Want to help Seattle prioritize how to spend $2 million of the cityâ€™s budget on park and street improvements? Community project prioritization is now open for [Your Voice, Your Choice: Parks & Streets](http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/your-voice-your-choice). Anyone can participate in Project Development if they live, work, go to school, receive services, volunteer, or have a connection to the City of Seattle.

If you would like to attend a prioritization meeting in person, there are two upcoming events for District 5.

Monday, May 6th, 5:30PM-7:30PM at [Lake City Library](http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/event-calendar?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D132110929) <br />
Thursday, May 30th, 5:30PM-7:30PM at [Broadview Branch Library](http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/event-calendar?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D132112207)

Alternatively, you can vote for projects [online](https://yvyc.consider.it/) until May 31st.

In District 5, check out these Licton Springs Projects:

* [Meridian Home Zone: Speed Humps](https://yvyc.consider.it/19-223) proposes an installation of speed humps to control speed and traffic volume on Corliss Ave N and Meridian Ave N between N 85th and N 92nd St.
* [Pedestrian Improvements: 88th & Wallingford](https://yvyc.consider.it/19-202) proposes adding a stop sign and 4-way crosswalk at 88th and Wallingford Ave N to help benefit residents of the area and children who attend the local schools.
