Last year we hosted an [outdoor movie & dog pawty](https://lovelicton.com/outdoor_dog_pawty_and_movie_night_success.html) in Mineral Springs Park. This kicked off a multi-year process for a proposal of a mini off-leash dog park (0.1 acres out of 4 acres) in Mineral Springs. The City of Seattle new off-leash area proposal process is focused on small, walkable, community dog parks. Currently, the closest dog parks to Licton Springs are on the south side of Green Lake and North Acres which are a 10 minute drive or 45 minute walk away. 

After many months of discussion with the city, we have moved into the second phase (out of seven phases) of planning and have been invited to submit a full proposal! The proposed dog park will not affect any existing North Park disc golf activities and is expected to be placed at the north end of the park by Northgate Way. Nets will be put up to protect discs and dogs! The existing native trees, art and greenspace will be protected per the city guidelines. This proposed dog park is a great way to increase the eyes on the park and build more community connections! 

In order to move forward with the proposal, we need your signatures to demonstrate community support to make this happen! If you are interested in signing in support of a dog park being built in Mineral Springs Park or have feedback / concerns you would like us to include in the proposal, please contact us at lovelicton@gmail.com.
