## Vote Now for your favorite Your Voice, Your Choice park and street improvements!

Want to help Seattle decide how to spend $2 million of the cityâ€™s budget on park and street improvements? Voting is now open for [Your Voice, Your Choice: Parks & Streets](http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/your-voice-your-choice). 

Voting is open to anyone age 11 and up (must be 13 and up to vote online) who lives, works, goes to school, worships, receives services, volunteers, or is part of a program in the City of Seattle.

Each voter may cast one ballot per City Council district, and may choose up to three (3) projects per district.

You can vote online [here](https://pbstanford.org/seattle) or by paper ballot at any Seattle Public Library branch.

You can find more information and voting instructions [here](http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/your-voice-your-choice/get-involved/vote). After ballots are tallied, the winning projects will be announced in October.
