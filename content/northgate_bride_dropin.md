We're excited to announce that construction of the Northgate Pedestrian and Bicycle Bridge is expected to begin in early 2020. 

The City of Seattle is hosting 3 drop-in sessions in early January. At the sessions you can learn about how this project will connect communities on the east and west sides of I-5 in north Seattle, review information at your own speed and get one-on-on engagement from project experts and learn about the project schedule and what to expect during construction.
