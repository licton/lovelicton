The grounds around Cascadia need some sprucing up and we need lots of help! Last year focused on weeding and mulching the beds around the parking lot. This year will continue last year’s efforts and expand to the beds all along Wallingford Avenue. Join the fun! Meet outside the school after drop-off on Friday, and we’ll make things better than we found them. Bring your own weeding gear if you have it—if not, we have tools you can use. No experience necessary! This is a great opportunity to pitch in for the greater good, build some community, and help make our school beautiful!
