Earlier this year, we wrote about the need for an [Aurora-Licton community center](https://lovelicton.com/aluv-community-center-cta.html). We are happy to report that $150,000 was granted for an Aurora/Licton Springs Community Center feasibility study as part of the [Seattle 2020 City Budget](https://juarez.seattle.gov/district-5-budget-wins-2020/).

You can join ALUV in celebrating this win (along with many others) on Thursday, December 12th from 7PM to 8:30PM at Lantern Brewing. Find the Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/2543178332579949/).
