We heard from the Licton Springs Community Council that the 2020 Licton Springs Halloween Trick â€˜o Treat event is canceled due to Covid-19. The council discussed possible ways to try to navigate the safety issues, but given restrictions set by both King County and the city, they found there was no safe way to hold the event. 

They hope to be back next year bigger and better than ever. 

Stay safe!
