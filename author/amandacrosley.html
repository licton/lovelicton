                <h2>Help Prioritize Neighborhood Street Fund Projects</h2>
<p>Community members have submitted over 300 projects for the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/neighborhood-street-fund">Neighborhood Street Fund</a> and now it is time for community prioritization of the initiatives. Every vote has a huge impact at this stage of the process.</p>
<p>Please consider supporting some of the proposed Licton Springs projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to help make Licton Springs more connected to Green Lake at N 85TH, including improving the <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-114?results=true">Wallingford Ave N crosswalk</a> (#2019-114) and the <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-25?results=true">Ashworth Ave N intersection</a> (#2019-25). These projects are listed as part of District 6 but would benefit both District 5 and District 6.</li>
<li>Improvements to Aurora Ave N including <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-116?results=true">adding lighting</a> (#2019-116), <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-75?results=true">additional art installations</a> (#2019-75) and <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-18?results=true">crosswalk safety improvements</a> (#2019-18).</li>
<li>A proposal to make <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-14?results=true">Stone Ave N</a> (#2019-14) a designated North / South Greenway providing safe pedestrian and bicycling access to schools, parks, and amenities.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a map of all the submitted projects <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/neighborhood-street-fund/projects-map">here</a>.</p>
<p>Upcoming Community Meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>District 6 - Crown Hill Center, Tuesday, January 29, 7pm to 8:30pm</li>
<li>District 5 - Broadview Branch Seattle Public Library, Thursday, January 31, 6pm to 7:30pm</li>
<li>District 5 - Lake City Community Center, Tuesday, February 5th, 6:30pm to 8pm</li>
<li>District 6 - Phinney Center Community Hall, Wednesday, February 13th, 6pm to 7:30pm</li>
</ul>
<p>To provide feedback, rank projects proposed in your district online <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/">here</a>, or at a Community Prioritization Meeting in your district. The meetings will begin with a presentation of all the projects proposed in the hosting district. Then, you will receive a score card, where you can rank your top projects and submit to SDOT staff. Top-ranked projects will proceed to the voting phase in spring 2019.</p>
<h3>Submit Ideas for Your Voice, Your Choice 2019:</h3>
<p>After voting on Neighborhood Street Fund Projects: help decide how to spend $2,000,000 of the City's budget on small-scale physical improvement projects to Seattle's parks &amp; streets through <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/your-voice-your-choice">Your Voice, Your Choice</a>!</p>
<p>Each project must:
<em> Benefit the public
</em> Cost $90,000 or less
* Be a physical project that is located within Seattle's parks or streets</p>
<p>Ideas may be submitted <a href="https://seattle.surveymonkey.com/r/YVYC-2019-ideas">online</a> or in-person at any Seattle Public Library branch or various public outreach events. Submit your ideas by February 22nd!</p>
