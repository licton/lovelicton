                <p>Where College Way N and Meridian Ave N meet in Licton Springs there is a small police station. That station is responsible for serving all of North Seattle. From Ballard to UDistrict, Fremont to Haller Lake, all of them are served by the North Precinct. This easily makes it the station that serves both the largest land area and population.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1pq76mrRNksF3pvM-Z0xgeFuBW-UuPdPn" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

<p>Naturally, this has led for many calls to split the precinct, or most recently, replace it with a new much larger location (on Aurora). However, thus far, there hasn't been political alignment to turn these calls into reality. The most recent of which was stopped by a counter campaign to <a href="http://council.seattle.gov/2016/09/16/sawant-block-the-bunker-activists-to-celebrate-victory-on-north-precinct-call-to-use-funds-for-housing/">"Block the Bunker"</a>, primarily driven from those who live in areas that aren't in the area served by the precinct they wish to block.</p>
<p>Now, if you walk by the precinct, you will be greeted by many land use signs. The North Precinct plans to increase its footprint at its current location.</p>
<p><a href="images/precinct/development.jpg"><img alt="North Precinct Expansion" src="images/precinct/development.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Where grass and greenery used to be, <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/NorthPrecinctStation/NorthPrecinctFlyer.pdf">the precinct plans to pave additional parking and add portables</a>.
The plan isn't meant to be a permanent solution, but the hope is it will enable the precinct to keep up with the next 5-7 years of growth.
And while there is concern by many over the loss of greenspace as <a href="http://web6.seattle.gov/dpd/edms/">illustrated in the public comments</a> (record # 3031508-LU), with no other agreed on options,
combined with an increasing call for greater public safety and police presence, it seems increasingly likely that we will see the start of an expanded precinct in Licton Springs come this time next year.</p>

                <p>Yesterday morning several neighbors came together at 85th and Meridian to clear away invasive weeds (looking at you blackberries!) and make way for an urban forest.</p>

<p>The work party was the second such event at the site and made significant progress:</p>
<p><a href="/images/trees/october.jpg"><img alt="Progress Made 1" src="/images/trees/october.jpg"></a>
<a href="/images/trees/june_1.jpg"><img alt="Progress Made 2" src="/images/trees/june_1.jpg"></a>
<a href="/images/trees/june_2.jpg"><img alt="Progress Made 3" src="/images/trees/june_2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Planting trees in the area, which borders an I5 off-ramp, will have a large positive impact on the neighborhood as highways and their ramps are a major source of pollution and noise. Trees have been shown to <a href="https://www.healthguidance.org/entry/8525/1/Trees-And-Shrubs-Can-Curb-Noise.html">reduce highway noise</a> while <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3022137/dont-like-pollution-in-your-home-plant-a-row-of-trees-and-breath-easier-by-half">cutting pollution by half</a>. The trees will work in tandem with the noise wall put in place in 2009 along I5 itself, to make Licton Springs a quieter and healthier neighborhood for all of us.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at the next work party!</p>

                <p>As we <a href="https://lovelicton.com/aurora-is-getting-cleaned-up.html">reported</a> back in May, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) added Licton Springs along Aurora Ave. to its pilot list of twice-weekly cleanup locations. Now SPU is asking residents and businesses in the area for their thoughts on the effectiveness of the Litter Abatement Pilot Program and the additional 2x/week litter cleanup it has provided. The survey seeks community thoughts on how they feel about cleanliness in their neighborhoods to determine next steps on the Litter Pilot Program. </p>

                <p>We learned today that the controversial Aurora Ave. tiny house village within Licton Springs will be closing for good March of next year. While many members of the local community have voiced their support for helping the least fortunate among us and have diligently donated food to the village, there has been disagreement that the village as designed is the best route to solve the problem. Since its creation there have been many complaints of crime that have been attributed to the village as well as a general concern around having an official policy of allowing illicit drug use just blocks from 3 schools, 2 of which are for elementary aged children.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://homelessness.seattle.gov/tiny-house-village-update-next-steps-for-licton-springs/">city's homeless response blog</a>, they identify finding permanent houses for the remaining residents as the top priority of the site ahead of its closure, with additional case management and partner agencies brought in to expedite the process.</p>
