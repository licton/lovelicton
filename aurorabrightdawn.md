When: April 27th 12:00 pm-1:00pm <br>
Who: Open to everyone.  <br>
What you can do: Although completely voluntary and not necessary to attend, Vicki Scuri is asking neighbors who would like to participate to donate 
[solar LED globes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011NVHX9A/ref=psdc_14193171_t4_B07D8N2KP1) that change colors. This donation will help by not only bringing a splash of color and light but also a sense of building community together.
