                <p>As we <a href="https://lovelicton.com/aurora-is-getting-cleaned-up.html">reported</a> back in May, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) added Licton Springs along Aurora Ave. to its pilot list of twice-weekly cleanup locations. Now SPU is asking residents and businesses in the area for their thoughts on the effectiveness of the Litter Abatement Pilot Program and the additional 2x/week litter cleanup it has provided. The survey seeks community thoughts on how they feel about cleanliness in their neighborhoods to determine next steps on the Litter Pilot Program. </p>

                <p>We learned today that the controversial Aurora Ave. tiny house village within Licton Springs will be closing for good March of next year. While many members of the local community have voiced their support for helping the least fortunate among us and have diligently donated food to the village, there has been disagreement that the village as designed is the best route to solve the problem. Since its creation there have been many complaints of crime that have been attributed to the village as well as a general concern around having an official policy of allowing illicit drug use just blocks from 3 schools, 2 of which are for elementary aged children.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://homelessness.seattle.gov/tiny-house-village-update-next-steps-for-licton-springs/">city's homeless response blog</a>, they identify finding permanent houses for the remaining residents as the top priority of the site ahead of its closure, with additional case management and partner agencies brought in to expedite the process.</p>

                <p>Today after extensive community feedback (at least 100 proponents of the moratorium and five against it) Seattle City Council unanimously passed a 6-month extension of its moratorium for new non-pedestrian-oriented developments within the Aurora Licton Urban Village:</p>

<p>The extension represents a victory for the <a href="http://auroralictonuv.org/">ALUV group</a> and associated members of the community who want to see Aurora transform into the center of a pedestrian friendly neighborhood that does its part to help soften our ongoing housing crises.</p>

<p>This leaves the final fate of the extension to Seattle City Council with a vote coming up this following Monday (the 24th of September).
If you have thoughts on the extension and have not yet made them heard, this represents your final opportunity, and I encourage you to follow the steps <a href="http://auroralictonuv.org/2018/08/28/interim-controls-extension/">ALUV has outlined</a> to contact your representatives.</p>
