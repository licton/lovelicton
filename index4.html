                <p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to disc golf or just disc golf alongside some other beginners and make friends? This next Tuesday (the 19th, a week and some change from now) at 6:30 PM we will be holding our first beginner's disc golf game, with help from members of the local disc golf community. At this event, you will not only be able to learn how to play alongside other beginners but will also be able to receive valuable tips from some more veteran disc golf players.</p>
<p><a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/course.jpg"><img alt="Course Map" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/course.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This event will be held at Mineral Springs park, located on the north end of Licton Springs. This course takes the honor of being the original and only Disc Golf course in Seattle proper. Being a city course it also has a more compact intricate design making it uniquely well suited to learning disc golf technique.</p>

<a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/hole_6.jpg"><img alt="Hole 6" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/hole_6.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Having never Disc Golfed ourselves, my wife and I went by the course this morning to get some sense of the game. In the course, we were struck by not only the beauty and tranquillity of a course nestled in the city but also by the friendliness of disc golfers. We ran into Mary and Tony who took us through both some of the basics of Disc Golf and the unique traits of this course.</p>
<p><a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/mary_and_tony.jpg"><img alt="Mary and Tony" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/mary_and_tony.jpg"></a></p>
<p>There are poles throughout the course used to hold up netting that separates pathways and different sections of the course.
They told us that every time your disc hits one of those poles and makes a little ringing sound, it's called North Park Love.</p>
<p><a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/poles.jpg"><img alt="North park love" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/poles.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Hope to enjoy the summer weather, learn how to Disc Golf, and ring in some North Park Love with some of you there!</p>

                <p>As part of the upcoming HALA legislation we have the unprecedented opportunity to reshape Aurora Avenue into the hub of a vibrant walkable community. Regardless what your thoughts are on the overall legislation, I encourage you to let our council members know what we as a community want from Aurora. For me that means more gems like the wonderful neighborhood shops that fill Oak Tree Plaza and fewer storage facilities. Either way, as the final public hearing happens tomorrow (June 5th) this may be your last opportunity to let the council know how you feel.</p>
<h2>From our friends at <a href="http://auroralictonuv.org/">ALUV</a>:</h2>
<p>Dear ALUV Friends and Neighbors, </p>
<p>Thank you for continued interest in bringing positive change to the Aurora Ave Corridor, specifically from N. 84th to N. 110th. As we continue our efforts to increase public safety via “eyes on the street” our biggest obstacle is the commercial zoning designation. This zoning has recently allowed for two public storage facilities to be built that provide no housing or walkable amenities to our Residential Urban Village as designated by the city in 1999. </p>
<p>Please email your support for the proposed zoning changes from Commercial (C) to Neighborhood Commercial (NC) to the Seattle City Council <a href="mailto: council@seattle.gov">council@seattle.gov</a> prior to JUNE 5th.</p>
<p>-&gt; <a href="http://auroralictonuv.org/2018/05/31/call-to-action-support-aurora-ave-rezoning/">Click here for the email template from ALUV</a>.</p>

                <p>The next time you walk or ride up Aurora you may notice it's cleaner than usual. In more ways than one, positive changes are starting to take hold on this historical Seattle Avenue. The city's proactive litter abatement pilot program <a href="http://komonews.com/news/local/pro-active-litter-teams-patrolling-six-seattle-neighborhoods">has added Licton Spring's stretch of Aurora</a> to its 2x weekly cleanup. This brave crew cleans up everything from coffee cups to used syringes, hopefully helping to encourage a sustainably clean street over time.</p>
<p>At the same time, SPD and Licton Spring's own North Precinct have been hard at work to bust a local pawn shop that incentivised theft within North Seattle. Along with the closure of the business, this had the side effect of finally permanently removing an Aurora fixture that we will all be happy to see go:</p>
<p><a href="/images/aurora/rare_coins.jpg"><img alt="Aurora Lady Statue" src="/images/aurora/rare_coins.jpg"></a></p>
<p>(See more on the <a href="http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2018/05/21/north-seattle-coin-shop-busted-for-selling-stolen-goods/">spdblotter</a>)</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/SR99/RoySt145thPaving/default.htm">Aurora is going to be repaved and sidewalk ramps made ADA compliant over the next year</a>. Which, while sure to be an inconvenience during construction and <a href="http://kuow.org/post/state-repaving-aurora-thats-chance-build-sidewalks-no">lacking the sidewalk improvements Aurora desperately needs</a>, will hopefully be worth it upon completion as it plays a part in increasing road safety and accessibility.</p>
<p>While more work is needed along this historic stretch of Seattle, it's encouraging that we are starting to see progress toward an Aurora that we can all take pride in.</p>

                <p>An anonymous reader of LoveLicton let us know about a celebrity living right here in Licton Springs:</p>
<p>The “tuxedo” cat, Henry, known by his stage name, Henri, Le Chat Noir, is a resident of our
neighborhood, though he lives in quiet obscurity, not troubled by his You-Tube fame. He plays the role
of a depressed, French cat in a series of videos that have garnered millions of viewers. Henry has over
170,000 Facebook followers and has been featured on Animal Planet and in People magazine. Henry also
has two books out on his philosophy and a Wikipedia page. But no French Riviera for this feline! “I love
Licton”, says Henry, “it’s the best place in the world for a spoiled, handsome cat.”</p>

                <p>A friend of the blog dropped a hint letting us know that a new traffic circle has been outlined for N 97th and Wallingford Ave N, which SDOT plans on having completed this summer! The circle will be a very welcome addition to the area, as, despite lots of warning signs and kids, sees more than its fair share of speeding.</p>
<p><a href="/images/street_improvements/signs.jpg"><img alt="Warning Signs" src="/images/street_improvements/signs.jpg"></a>

<a href="/images/street_improvements/circle.jpg"><img alt="Location of new Circle" src="/images/street_improvements/circle.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This new circle will complement the existing one at N 95th, hopefully reducing speed driving up Wallingford.</p>
<p><a href="/images/street_improvements/circle.jpg"><img alt="95th Circle" src="/images/street_improvements/95th.jpg"></a></p>
<p>On my walk up to N 97th, I also noticed initials outlines for a continuation of the N 92nd bike path by the new School.</p>

<p>You can find out about some more street improvements scheduled to be completed this year on <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/greenways-program/north-seattle">SDOT's Greenway &amp; School Safety Project Website</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy this great weather! And hopefully, as the season progresses, we will all be able to enjoy some safer streets!</p>
