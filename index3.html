                <p>Mineral Springs park has had a busy and successful month! See below for a summary of July's events and some ways to get involved this month.</p>
<h3>Community Connection:</h3>
<p>On July 3rd, the community around Mineral Springs park met to discuss future events and initiatives in the park. If you'd like to get involved, the next Seattle Parks community meeting will be held on <strong>Tuesday, August 14th from 6-7pm at Meridian Center for Health, room 110</strong>.</p>
<h3>Disc Golf:</h3>
<p>Did you know that the Mineral Springs Park is the only disc golf course in the city of Seattle? On July 12th, Seattle Parks department met with the disc golf community to discuss needed improvements to the disc golf course in Mineral Springs Park. Additionally, on July 17th, LoveLicton.com held its second "Learn to Disc Golf" event in partnership with the local disc golfers. The event was a resounding success! We will be holding our next beginner's disc golf event on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1749802818460952/">Tuesday, August 21st from 6:30pm to 8pm</a>.</p>

<h3>Clean up:</h3>
<p>On July 19th, the community came together for a Mineral Springs Park work party to help increase visibility in the park and clear tremendous amounts of brush and blackberries, primarily from the southeast corner along the walkway. You can really see the difference!</p>
<p><a href="/images/mineral_springs/park_cleanup.jpg"><img alt="Neighborhood comes together to clean up" src="/images/mineral_springs/park_cleanup.jpg"></a>

<a href="/images/mineral_springs/park_cleanup_3.jpg"><img alt="Neighborhood comes together to clean up" src="/images/mineral_springs/park_cleanup_3.jpg"></a></p>
<p>the next cleanup will be held on <strong>Thursday, August 16th from 5-7pm</strong>.</p>
<h3>Celebrate:</h3>
<p>On July 21st, the community, in partnership with Seattle Parks, held their first event - a free BBQ! Lawn games, live music, food, and neighborhood bonding! Lots of fun was had by all.  Thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/howshortjazz/">How Short</a> for keeping us entertained with live jazz and our neighborhood volunteers who tended to the grills! Look out for our next event later this summer/early fall.
<a href="/images/mineral_springs/bbq_summary.jpg"><img alt="BBQ" src="/images/mineral_springs/bbq_summary.jpg"></a></p>
<p>It's been amazing meeting so many wonderful people from the area and seeing the community come together around this Licton Spring's gem.
Let's keep up the community engagement! Hope to see you at some of the upcoming events.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2018/July/25-metro-service-amazon-seattle.aspx">Starting this September the frequency of the E Line, in addition to many other regional bus lines, will be increased</a>. This change is happening thanks to a partnership between Amazon, the City of Seattle, and King County Metro. This will be a particularly welcome addition over the next few years as the <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/metros-convention-place-station-closing-saturday-for-good">recent closure of the Convention Place Station</a> reroutes our other popular bus line into downtown: the 41 - leading to possible delays until the light rail construction is complete.</p>
<p><a href="/images/aurora/more_frequent.jpg"><img alt="More Frequent E Line Service" src="/images/aurora/more_frequent.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This change will positively affect many as the E Line is Metro’s highest-ridership route with more than 17,000 weekday riders.</p>

                <p>Whether you call it Licton Springs, North Green Lake, North College Park, or that magical portal in-between Green Lake, Greenwood, and the Northgate mall - we are all proud to call it home. And, apparently, according to a new report from Redfin, we are not the only ones who would like to do so. Licton Springs showed up on <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/redfins-new-compete-score-ranks-markets-based-competition-homes-seattle-toughest/">Redfin's report</a> as the #1 most competitive neighborhood to buy into, in not only Seattle, but the entire United States.</p>

<p>We tied with ourselves (under the name North College Park, yep we are in the report twice) and 5 other neighborhoods including nearby Phinney Ridge for the spot. Having also received a property taxable value reassessment notice today, I'm not entirely sure it's a placement any of us were looking to achieve...</p>

                <p>A friend of the blog wrote in to let us know the construction of the North Seattle Neighborhood Greenway project down 100th Ave N is set to begin as soon as tomorrow.
The project aims to connect Crown Hill, Greenwood, and Licton Springs both to each other and to the upcoming pedestrian bridge that will provide direct access to the Northgate light rail station. While the entire project, which will stretch around 2 miles, is a welcome addition - of particular interest to those in the Licton Springs area are a <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/Greenways/N100thStFactsheet.pdf">new sidewalk from Linden Ave N to Aurora Ave N</a> and sidewalk improvements being made between Aurora Ave N and Stone Ave N.</p>
<p><a href="images/2018_greenway/banner.jpg"><img alt="Linden currently without sidewalk" src="images/2018_greenway/banner.jpg"></a>

<a href="images/2018_greenway/greenway_area.jpg"><img alt="100th in Licton Springs" src="images/2018_greenway/greenway_area.jpg"></a></p>
<p>When the work is complete, the hope is that it will be possible to safely walk or ride a bicycle all the way from Crown Hill to the new light rail station, with sidewalk at a  minimum from Linden Ave N eastward. You can find more information about the project on <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/greenways-program/north-seattle">SDOT's overview page</a>. The project should take around 6 months to complete with individual neighbors being directly contacted as construction work that impacts them is underway.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the traffic circle on Wallingford Ave N and N 97th <a href="https://lovelicton.com/street_improvements_preview_2018.html">we wrote about earlier this year</a> has now been completed and is just awaiting greenery.</p>
<p><a href="images/2018_greenway/circle.jpg"><img alt="Wallingford Ave N Circle" src="images/2018_greenway/circle.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We look forward to a safer and more walkable North Seattle!</p>

                <p>A member of the community has come forth to formally appeal the development of the old Gold's Gym location, which helped compliment other nearby business such as Emerald City Smoothie, into a storage facility. The area in question has a moratorium on non-pedestrian oriented businesses, but the permit for the storage facility was placed right before it was put into effect. Beyond Aurora, the property is surrounded by homes and townhouses, and there is a strong desire by many within the area to increase housing and retail along Aurora, by lining it with apartment complexes that contain retail on the bottom. The thought being, that this would increase the safety of Aurora while helping to soften our current housing crises.</p>

<a href="/images/golds_gym/houses_behind_gym.jpg"><img alt="Houses behind gym" src="/images/golds_gym/houses_behind_gym.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The appeal comes as "Greenlake" Self-storage continues its construction just a few blocks south.</p>
<p><a href="/images/golds_gym/greenlake.jpg"><img alt="Greenlake Self-Storage" src="/images/golds_gym/greenlake.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The hearing for the appeal is set for 9 AM on Monday, Aug. 13, at the City of Seattle Hearing Examiner’s Office, Seattle Municipal Tower, 700 5th Ave., 40th Floor. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hearings are open to the public, but generally only those who are parties to the appeal and persons called by the parties as witnesses will have the opportunity to testify. A person who has not appealed, but who has a substantial interest in the outcome of the appeal, may request to be allowed to participate in an appeal as an “intervenor”. An intervenor, like the parties, would have the option of appealing the Hearing Examiner’s decision in this matter. Intervenor status should be requested as soon as possible prior to hearing and in accordance with the Hearing Examiner Rules. For information regarding appeals and intervenor status, contact or visit the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner’s office provides barrier-free access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for the appeal reflects the concerns shared by many:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My interest is to maintain some sense of residential and environmental
neighborhood atmosphere. This project unfortunately has been grandfathered into the rezoning of
past. The current rezoning would not support this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the full reasoning behind the appeal as well as all supporting documents on <a href="https://web6.seattle.gov/Examiner/case/MUP-18-015">Seattle's Hearing Examiner site</a>.</p>
