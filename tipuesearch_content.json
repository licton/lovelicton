{"pages":[{"title":"About Licton Springs","text":"Licton Springs or North Green Lake is a small neighborhood located between Aurora Ave N and I5 North in the area they most closely converge within North Seattle: The Proximity to the 2 most major North/South routes in Seattle as well as quick access to the E Line, Northgate Transit Center, and future light rail combine to make Licton Springs one of the most well connected neighborhoods in Seattle with Downtown Seattle almost always < 15 minutes away. The small size of the neighborhood means from the center you can walk to the East or West edge in 7 minutes or the North or South in 10, making those who live in Licton Springs feel connected to not only Licton Springs but the surrounding neighborhoods.

These events are often hosted through a partnership with other local groups and institutions. Events range in purpose from bringing the community together, to making a reverberating impact across Seattle. Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues. To support a welcoming environment for all, regardless of individual differences, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they participate in this community's activities. These rules apply equally to founders, organizers, moderators, sponsors, and affiliates — in short, to all participants. This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you must do, or can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended. It's a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate, and which we represent. The principles Be friendly and welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, neighborhood, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental or physical ability. Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the LoveLicton community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the community. Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of neighbors, and we conduct ourselves with empathy. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants, individually or as a group. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent threats or language directed against another person. Discriminatory jokes and language. Posting sexually explicit or violent material. Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\"). Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms. Unwelcome sexual attention. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Where does the code of conduct apply This code of conduct applies to all spaces and events managed by LoveLicton. This includes: The LoveLicton.com Blog Fun Events Community Meetings Conferences (including social events and peripheral activities) Meetups Workshops Presentation materials used in talks or sessions Mailing lists Twitter and Twitter hashtag Facebook meetup.com discussion boards GitHub Any other forums created by the community and used for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them. Sponsors, affiliates, and exhibitors When you sponsor a LoveLicton event, we welcome you as a member of our community, and we expect you to be respectful to the community you operate within. All partners of any form are also subject to the code of conduct. In addition, sponsors and affiliates of conference, meetups, and online activities should not employ aggressive recruiting techniques, invasive marketing behavior, or similar actions towards community members. In case of violations, sponsors might be sanctioned and expelled from the event or activity with no return of the sponsorship contribution. What to do in case of violations If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct during one of our events, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. Event staff are introduced at the beginning of every event, but if you missed the introduction or cannot find a staff member please reach out to us by emailing lovelicton@gmail.com with \"Violation Report\" in the title. All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases a public statement might be required (for example in a CoC transparency report following an event), but these reports are anonymized and do not include any personally identifying information. Thanks This code of conduct is largely based on the PuPPy groups Code of Conduct , which is based largely off Write The Docs Code of Conduct , which in turn is based on the Django Project Code of Conduct and the original text of the Speak Up! project, inspired in its turn by the Fedora Project, as well as the Python Mentorship Project and many others.","tags":"Information","url":"https://lovelicton.com/pages/code_of_conduct.html"},{"title":"Search","text":"⚲ Browse By: Categories Tags Authors","tags":"Information","url":"https://lovelicton.com/pages/search.html"},{"title":"June Community Resources & Connections","text":"Every month, we share the upcoming community events in Licton Springs.

Seattle Department of Neighborhoods is asking community members to democratically decide how to spend $2 million of the City's budget on these improvements. From February 18 to March 18, community members age 11 and up (13 and up to participate online) who live, work, go to school, receive services, or participate in activities in Seattle can submit their idea online or in-person at any Seattle Public Library branch. Projects could include park benches, trail improvements, marked crosswalks, and sidewalk repair, to name a few. The only criteria are the project ideas focus on physical improvements to Seattle's parks or streets, benefit the public, and cost $150,000 or less. Once ideas are submitted, volunteers are recruited to turn the ideas into 8 – 10 proposals per council district. Then this summer, everyone will have the opportunity to vote for the top projects within their district. Of the $2 million budget, approximately $185,00 is allocated to each council district. The remaining funds are allocated to projects in underrepresented communities or Equity and Environment Initiative (EEI) Focus Areas. Share your ideas today!

A tiny house village opened on the street 2 years ago, while reports indicated that crime was concentrating in the area. Then, after months of escalating tensions, a homeless man was shot and killed on Nesbit . While all of this was occurring, a large seemingly abandoned lot, and 2 large construction projects left few eyes on the street. This led Seattle Neighborhood Group to create a Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) report on the 8800th block of Nesbit at the end of 2017, and then survey neighbors about the area last year. Since then, the tiny house village has announced its permanent closure, to be replaced with a 112 unit affordable housing project built by LIHI : On the street, branches have been trimmed, new lights installed to improve visibility, and sharps containers planned. And of course, construction projects are getting closer to completion: Seattle Neighborhood Group wants to keep this momentum going, and is hosting a community meeting to discuss the survey and improvements this Thursday: The meeting will be held at the nearby Cascadia Elementary School, January 17th, 6-7:30 PM.

We at LoveLicton wanted to wish you a happy Thanksgiving! We have so much to be thankful for this year: Our readers and community members that together make this a great place to call home. Licton Springs Community Council as they've continued their great work of giving a unified voice to all community members and helping to lead community events (including the phenomenal Halloween event at Licton Springs Park). ALUV who has been working tirelessly to improve the Aurora Corridor. Their latest work can be seen on the Aurora Ave N. pedestrian bridge art project. Licton Springs P-Patch leadership really making our p-patch not only beautiful but a cornerstone of the community. Licton-haller Greenways / Seattle Neighborhood Greenways working to make North Seattle and Licton Springs walkable and bikeable. They've been crucial in the creation of many Licton Springs Greenways such as the one nearing completion on N 100TH street, and have been working on North Seattle's pioneering Home Zone Pilot right here in Licton Springs. Epic Life Church has consistently been there for the community. Allowing community meetings to be hosted in their church, leading a cleanup down along Aurora Ave N., and hosting community events. Meridian Health Center which has served as the closest thing to a Licton Springs Community Center. They've hosted all the Licton Springs Community Council meetings, Mineral Springs Park meetings, and even community events such as Saturday's board game event . Friends of Mineral Springs Park , Mineral Springs Disc Golf Club , and Seattle Parks and Recreation as they've worked to bring a strong sense of community to Seattle's only Disc Golf Park. This has lead to many events being held at the park and increased / more varied usage. Pilgrim Coffee set up in Oak Tree Plaza when we needed them most and have been roasting and brewing excellent coffee for the community. North Seattle College who've worked with the city and local community members to ensure a safe, appealing, and environmental conscience bridge is built from Licton Springs to the upcoming Northgate Lightrail Station. They've also been working with us to ensure Licton Springs and North Seattle College become a hotbed of Open Source innovation . Northwest Danish Association beyond all the great work they do for our Danish residents, they opened up their doors on many occasions for community-wide events. Buy Nothing Licton Springs who has done more than just provide a venue for the exchange of items, providing a forum for constructive community conversation, and the sharing of community events. All the other countless local businesses and non-profits in Licton Springs. We hope you enjoy the holiday with your family and loved ones! And after the holiday and Black Friday shopping is over we hope to unwind with some of you over coffee and board games: Happy Thanksgiving!","tags":"Holidays","url":"https://lovelicton.com/happy-thanksgiving-2018.html"},{"title":"Home Zone Pilot Moves Forward","text":"Significant progress has been made since we originally introduced the Licton Spring's Home Zone Pilot back in August. Just recently the City passed $350K in funding for Home Zone Pilots (the Licton Springs pilot being the first such in North Seattle), following an article about the project on Crosscut . If all goes well, some of this funding will help to compliment the Small Sparks grant the community was awarded for the project as well as funding received from Seattle Neighborhood Greenways . All of which, was accomplished after the community gave valuable input , shaping what such a project would look like in Licton Springs. After discussion with the community and collection of initial traffic counts, we've coalesced on some simple initial steps: Intersection / Street Art Planters placed along the roads without sidewalks Pedestrian Wayfinding / newsletter signs A professionally performed traffic study Despite the progress that has been made - walking around the neighborhood, for the most part, everything still looks untouched. While the community has identified many locations that they believe would be suitable for street art, it is not feasible to paint the street during Seattle's rainy season, leaving such work to wait for next year. And, while there have been some areas identified as potentially suitable for planters, this work will not begin until permits are secured and impacted households are contacted and give their direct approval. Meanwhile, there is at least one physical reflection of the project, as the first prototype wayfinding sign was installed at the corner of N 88th and Burke Ave N right before Halloween: The sign was constructed by volunteers using basic material and equipment: A standard pre-treated 4 x 4 inch x 8 feet post . Outdoor & weatherproof resilience paint from the Licton Spring's Sherwin Williams (6797 Jay Blue, 6740 Kilkenny, & 7077 Original White) 2 inch and 1 inch white vinyl letters 2 1/2 x 4 x 8 Hemlock Boards cut into 2 foot sections (for the direction signs) During the construction of the sign, which costs well under $200 to build, significant lessons were learned that will be applied to any future wayfinding signs: The directions were painted on one side of each direction sign, with a solid color on the other, this can lead to the wayfinding sign seeming blank from some angles. Future signs will be 4 inches longer and have the locations printed on both sides. Some of the direction wood pieces split slightly where they were attached to the main post. Having the directions not use the 4 inches where the connection needs to be made, as well as making pilot holes into the connection points, should remedy this issue for future signs. Over-sized rubber bands are an amazing tool to line up letters. Stencils tend to bleed, and even if they don't they have an amateur appearance. Vinyl letters are cheap, easy, and if done right, resilient. A clear coat, such as Polyurethane, should be applied after letters are placed to ensure they stay in place and offer extra protection against the elements. These really are fun to make! Finally, to both this wayfinding sign and future ones, we will be adding a brochure box where community members will always be able to physically pick up a community newsletter and know about upcoming events and happenings in the neighborhood. Want a wayfinding sign in your lawn strip? As part of the Home Zone project, there is an opportunity to get a wayfinding sign installed on your lawn strip! If you are interested, please sign up here . This opportunity is available to any homeowner within Licton Springs. Want to help out? Want to help move the project forward? Have artistic ability or are willing to help build planter boxes or signs? Willing to reach out to neighbors or host a meeting? Please sign up here ! What's next? Over the next few months expect to see the first prototype planter/traffic calming measure installed. Expect opportunities to provide feedback on the initial traffic calming measures, as well as initially proposed street art. Then as, weather permits, expect street art painting to begin. What do you think about the Home Zone project? Have any feedback on the initial wayfinding sign? We'd love to hear from you in the comments below! Happy Thanksgiving!","tags":"Information","url":"https://lovelicton.com/home-zone-november-2018-update.html"},{"title":"Make your mark on the Aurora Bridge Art Project","text":"If you are as excited about the ongoing art project on the Aurora Pedestrian Bridge as we are , you will be thrilled to hear there is now an opportunity to meet neighbors and help enhance the project! This coming weekend (Saturday the 17th and Sunday the 18th), neighbors will be meeting 10:00am-4:00pm to prepare the soil and then plant over 3 thousand daffodil bulbs. The project will be completed in two steps, first preparing the soil on Saturday and then planting on Sunday: Aurora Bridge Art Installation - Ground Prep Aurora Bridge Art Installation - Daffodil Planting Wear heavy gloves and yard shoes.

Back in September, we saw our first positive change as the 41 bus received more frequent service . However, as Seattle prepares for the period of maximum constraint early next year, you can expect even more changes to come to our transit station. The first major change coming is the opening of the new parking garage to the north of the station, coinciding with the close of the 2 west side lots: The new parking garage will contain 450 parking spots, more than making up for the closed lots, but some of the new spots will be reserved for paying customers . More information about the parking changes can be found on Sound Transit's overview . These changes will take effect Monday, November 19th. Then, come March of next year, big changes are planned for our fastest connection to Bellevue - the 555 . The route will be updated to bypass Montlake and operate only between Northgate and Bellevue, no longer serving Eastgate or Issaquah. This should result in much quicker and dependable transit times for those commuting between Licton Springs and Downtown Bellevue. Finally, with land usage signs now visible around the North Seattle College's Campus, construction on the pedestrian bridge from Licton Springs to the transit center has passed its biggest hurdles and is set to begin construction next year. Here's to hoping all the transit changes lead to a quicker more dependable commute!","tags":"Information","url":"https://lovelicton.com/northgate-transit-changes-2018.html"},{"title":"Coffee is back in Licton Springs!","text":"We've just been given news we couldn't be happier to report: Pilgrim Coffee is coming to Oak Tree plaza!

It's been a little less than two months since Starbucks left Licton Spring's urban village , leaving the area without any coffee options. Tomorrow that all changes. While many would have been content with almost any Coffee Shop setting up at the location, we couldn't be more ecstatic that our favorite Coffee Truck is setting up right in front of the old Starbucks. We've been a fan of Pilgrim Coffee for a while, as they've roasted some great coffee right here in the neighborhood: It also doesn't hurt that the opening happens at the perfect time for holiday-inspired drinks: We hope you will join us drinking some great local coffee!","tags":"Retail Openings","url":"https://lovelicton.com/pilrim_coffee_comes_to_oaktree.html"},{"title":"Leaves are Falling & Autumn is Here: November Community Events","text":"Correction (11/5/18): The ALUV meeting has been cancelled this month due to scheduling conflicts.

That station is responsible for serving all of North Seattle. From Ballard to UDistrict, Fremont to Haller Lake, all of them are served by the North Precinct. This easily makes it the station that serves both the largest land area and population. Naturally, this has led for many calls to split the precinct, or most recently, replace it with a new much larger location (on Aurora). However, thus far, there hasn't been political alignment to turn these calls into reality. The most recent of which was stopped by a counter campaign to \"Block the Bunker\" , primarily driven from those who live in areas that aren't in the area served by the precinct they wish to block. Now, if you walk by the precinct, you will be greeted by many land use signs. The North Precinct plans to increase its footprint at its current location. Where grass and greenery used to be, the precinct plans to pave additional parking and add portables . The plan isn't meant to be a permanent solution, but the hope is it will enable the precinct to keep up with the next 5-7 years of growth. And while there is concern by many over the loss of greenspace as illustrated in the public comments (record # 3031508-LU), with no other agreed on options, combined with an increasing call for greater public safety and police presence, it seems increasingly likely that we will see the start of an expanded precinct in Licton Springs come this time next year.","tags":"Construction","url":"https://lovelicton.com/north-precinct-set-to-grow.html"},{"title":"North Seattle Prepares for Light Rail","text":"Earlier this month, residents of North Seattle gathered to share information, resources, and get connected at U District's Let's Go Transit Talk.

The pedestrian bridge will be open during cleaning and painting, although a worker may escort you through the work zone. There may be temporary bridge closures. In six to eight weeks, Vicki Scuri's art installation will be installed. Inspired by the sunrise, this project adds color and pattern to an aging pedestrian bridge, transforming it into a community landmark gateway. Hundreds of translucent colorful fins transition through the hues of the sunrise across the span of the bridge. The four foot tall and six and half inch wide fins sit on the outside of and attach to the railings. The fins elevate the bridge into a unique art experience for both the cars traveling under and the pedestrians above. The colors on the translucent fins will shift and blend as the viewer moves through the site, creating a dynamic experience. The bridge's columns and stair hold colorful painted graphic, connecting the artwork directly to the site. This project was funded by the Neighborhood Street Fund program to enhance safety and add visual identity for the Aurora-Licton Urban Village.

While many members of the local community have voiced their support for helping the least fortunate among us and have diligently donated food to the village, there has been disagreement that the village as designed is the best route to solve the problem.

After a brief introduction about the desire of the pilot and the inherent limitations due to a small budget size, neighbors split up into groups to separately tackle traffic calming, community art, and wayfinding. During the meeting the following existing areas of concern were identified: Significant and fast cut-through traffic through both Meridian and Corliss which, combined with lack of sidewalks, causes an impediment to pedestrian activity. Fast traffic is coming down the hill from 90th and Meridian to 90th and Burke. This area already has a lot of pedestrian activity, but speed combined with the lack of a safe intersection has already led to a collision and many near collisions with both pedestrians and other vehicles. Non-ideal crossing conditions at 90th and Wallingford. A child who attended the meeting shared their story of near collision occurring just a few days prior. Other areas near the school have flashing pedestrian signs, but this intersection lacks them. Proposal being explained During the meeting, there was also concern expressed around a previous proposal to close Meridian off at 92nd with a \"Do Not Enter\" sign. Much of the concern centered around the fact that closing off the street could move the traffic onto other roads, in particular, Corliss, while not addressing walkability. This lined up well with much of the Anonymous feedback we received from our online survey : I don't understand the problem this is fixing. Closing Meridian does nothing for the 90th Street Burke hill, through which half the neighborhood drains out, will make the backup at 92nd & College worse, while causing daily irritation and delay for the other half of the neighborhood in getting home (or causing them to speed down the hill on 90th north of Meridian, too). Traffic calming on the Burke hill I'm all in favor of, but don't understand the benefit for the rest. With regard to the current proposal, at 92nd and Meridian I would prefer that it be a \"local access only\" sign instead of a one-way street / do not enter sign. I like the idea for the street planters, stop signs, speed bump at 90th and burke, and the street art at 88th and burke. The North Greenwood traffic calming maze is a nightmare. What do the residents over there think about having to drive many more blocks to get where they want or the increased east/west traffic down their formerly quiet residential streets? So I am skeptical about the proposed Home Pilot Program. The plan that the people living at the north end of Meridian to get home from College Way now, instead of a left turn, one block, right turn and into driveway, will be making a right turn, one block, stop, left turn 2 blocks, stop, left turn 2 blocks stop, left turn, weave among planters and finally home. Also, since I live on Corliss, I'm not happy at the prospect of increased traffic from cars trying to get to Meridian from the East. There are a LOT of pedestrians, (students, elderly, young families, dog walkers) that use our sidewalk-less street. I plan to make a count on a weekday to corroborate that statement. Are not the proposals to close off access to 85th at Meridian and put a stop sign at 90th sufficient to really cut down traffic volumes and speed? A Local Access Only sign at 92nd and Corliss is fairly meaningless. I hope you put the walking sign at the corner of the school grounds and not in someone's front yard. The speed bump crosswalk at N. 90th and Burke is fine if it is something the people in the houses at that corner feel is necessary. It is a residential intersection at the bottom of a steep hill with parked cars often making progress to Wallingford slow anyway. Cars SHOULD be crawling there. As for the proposed art, no comment until I see what and where. I like many of the ideas (stop signs and planters on Meridian Ave N), with the exception of blocking southbound access to Meridian Ave N at N 92nd street. The reason for not preferring this option is that in wintertime during snow conditions southbound access provides a safer route home (avoiding steep hills) and that blocking access would lengthen the drive through residential neighborhoods to get to my home. My observation is that most of the problem with fast cars driving through the neighborhood in the morning is due to northbound cars (not southbound cars). Thanks for your consideration. After discussion, the community seemed to coalesce around the idea of working to limit speed on both Meridian and Corliss with inexpensive traffic calming measures, rather than entirely block access. Many ideas were brought up to increase the walkability of the area including: Intersection art at 90th and Burke Ave N. The hope is that this would clearly mark the intersection encouraging vehicles to slow down and yield for pedestrians. Wayfinding signs in various forms throughout the neighborhood. Traffic calming measures, such as strategically placed planters and/or chicanes, evenly applied on both Meridian and Corliss. Setting up a weekly play street on one of the unsidewalked blocks. Pedestrian activated crosswalk on 90th and Wallingford. With the immediate next steps focused on art and wayfinding as traffic calming requires permit approval from SDOT and will take more time to put in place. There is still plenty of time to provide feedback or get involved! To do so take the survey or email meridianhomezone@gmail.com . You can also keep up with the latest on the home zone at bit.ly/walkzone which I'll do my best to update as more input is gathered and proposals are modified or implemented.","tags":"Information","url":"https://lovelicton.com/home-zone-2018-meeting-1.html"},{"title":"Fall Into This Month's Community Events","text":"Wow!

Unfortunately, I recently had to report on the upcoming closure of the Oak Tree Starbucks , the only Coffee Shop within the Aurora Licton Urban Village (ALUV). This came not too long after the nearby Gold's Gym, which brought additional caffeine craving foot traffic to the area, closed to be replaced by a storage facility. This facility did have an appeal put forth , but it was dropped before being heard. This is one of 2 large storage facilities being built in the area. And while some storage is undoubtedly necessary, it is sad to see so much land taken off the market. Property that could instead be used for much needed additional housing which would support a thriving retail core within ALUV. As it is, the village is set to contain at least four storage facilities and not a single coffee shop. The only thing that has kept even more of the land along Aurora from being repurposed for storage use is a temporary moratorium that was put in place October 2017, right after these storage facilities applied for permits. When this moratorium was passed, the intention was that it would act as a stop-gap measure until permanent zoning changes took effect with the passage of HALA. Predictably though, that law has been delayed by legal challenges, leaving the moratorium set to expire soon with no zoning changes in place. On Wednesday, Sept. 5th at 9:30 AM the Seattle City Council Planning, Land Use and Zoning (PLUZ) Committee will hold a public hearing on the renewal of the Interim Zoning Controls for the Aurora Licton Residential Urban Village. We hope to encourage you to come out in support of the extension and/or email the Seattle City Council with your thoughts. I want to make it clear: this is not an attack on the many existing businesses along Aurora that may fall into the categories being blocked by this extension. Many of them are family run, have been here for decades, and have always done their best to help the community. We are glad they are here, appreciate their contributions, and hope they continue to thrive. This zoning extension and the permanent zoning changes proposed will not affect existing businesses or already pending permits. The goal is only to encourage more housing, and pedestrian-friendly businesses are built in existing empty lots and new lots as they become available. We believe this will result in a more lively and friendly area that will benefit both residents and existing businesses alike. Call to Action: We hope you will work with ALUV to extend the Aurora zoning controls and help ensure a vibrant Aurora Village has a chance.","tags":"Aurora","url":"https://lovelicton.com/aurora-zone-controls-extension-2018.html"},{"title":"Starbucks's Original North Seattle Store is Closing","text":"It's a sad day for Starbucks lovers in Licton Springs. After 31 years the Oak Tree Starbucks location is set to close permanently this September. The location was Starbuck's first to open in North Seattle and one of the 10 original stores. Regulars, some of who have been going to the store since it first opened, have been given the news they will soon need to get their caffeine fix elsewhere. A hard pill to swallow, without a single coffee shop available within a 15 Minute Walk. The closure will add to the many other empty storefronts at the plaza: Many of which closed after the complex lost Larry's Markets and with it significant foot traffic. And while the complex has recently had a bit of a revitalization in the last year, with the remodeled AMC bringing in a substantial increase in customers, the Starbuck's 6 PM closing schedule may not have effectively leveraged the bulk of the additional movie traffic. At the end of the day, while many things may have contributed to the closure: Many new Starbucks opening nearby. Including one on N 84TH that is more easily accessible for pass-through traffic w/ a drive-through. Few evening hours. A growing preference to frequent small independent coffee stores, even if that means drinking coffee near where you work instead of where you live. The store is closing for the reason most business closures happen: it is not profitable. While many will be sad to see it go, we can only hope it leads to a small independent coffee shop finally opening in Licton Springs - just like the Starbucks itself was when it opened in the area so many years ago. If you'd like to contact Starbuck's Corporate about the closure, you can use this form to do so.","tags":"Retail Closings","url":"https://lovelicton.com/original_north_seattle_starbucks_closing.html"},{"title":"North Seattle Picnics in the Precincts is This Saturday!","text":"Did you know the only Police Station in all of North Seattle is right here in Licton Springs?

Home Zones represent an innovative and inexpensive approach to increasing walkability, safety, and the sense of community in neighborhoods that lack full sidewalk coverage. The pilot will cover the area north of 85TH, south of 92ND, west of I5 and east of Wallingford Ave. N Below is a map of the area, as well as some of the ideas that have already been proposed for the pilot: This area was chosen, in particular, because it represents a small well-defined area in which to prove out the concept. If the pilot is successful: it could be expanded both to other areas in Licton Springs and throughout greater North Seattle. Why are home zones something to get excited about? It is known by many that Seattle has a sidewalk, or rather lack thereof, problem. As shown in this map prepared by SDOT in 2015, over a quarter of Seattle is laking sidewalk. Most of the need is concentrated in North Seattle, predominantly north of N 85th. And while Licton Springs is lucky to have the best sidewalk coverage of any neighborhood this far North, it still has less sidewalk coverage than any of the communities immediately to the south of it. There's an often repeated claim that Seattle promised all these areas sidewalk when they were annexed so many decades ago. And, while I haven't definitively been able to determine if that claim is fact or folklore , the city is slowly keeping that promise . The only problem: starting at around $500K+ per a single block, sidewalks are expensive. At the current rate of expenditure, it will take over 300 years for all of Seattle to have sidewalks. What are Home Zones and how do they aim to solve this problem? A Home Zone is an area that is protected from lots of fast moving traffic so that streets are safe enough to walk on. Home Zones keep local access for residents, emergency access, and deliveries while discouraging cut-through traffic. Home Zones can use a variety of street improvements to accomplish this but focus on improvements that have the best \"bang for our buck\" recognizing Seattle's pedestrian budget is stretched very thin. Home Zones are meant to: Make it safe and comfortable for people of all ages and abilities to walk in a neighborhood Reduce cut-through traffic and speeding by keeping this traffic on the arterials (not increasing traffic on other neighborhood streets), while allowing neighbors to get to their homes, emergency access, deliveries, etc. Enhance the quality of life for neighbors and strengthen our community (one way to do this is by integrating community art). In essence: Home Zones aim to offer a drastically less expensive alternative to improve the walkability of currently unsidewalked streets, while also achieving a greater and more cohesive sense of community than can be made with sidewalks alone. Can I donate to the effort? Seattle Neighborhood Greenways which is a local nonprofit working to make every neighborhood a great place to walk, bike, and live, is currently supporting this project with staff time and resources. You can donate to help make this a reality at seattlegreenways.org . Or contact Gordon@seattlegreenways.org for more information. What happens next? How can I get involved? If you live in or near the pilot area or want to give input on the very first North Seattle home zone, you can find more information about the details of this project here . Additionally, we encourage you to fill out the survey here or email us at meridianhomezone@gmail.com to be kept up to date on the project. The first public in-person meeting to provide feedback will be held at the Meridian Health Center (10521 Meridian Ave) starting at 6:30 PM September 13th. If able, please register your intention to attend the meeting on Seattle Greenways home zone website .

The area in question has a moratorium on non-pedestrian oriented businesses, but the permit for the storage facility was placed right before it was put into effect. Beyond Aurora, the property is surrounded by homes and townhouses, and there is a strong desire by many within the area to increase housing and retail along Aurora, by lining it with apartment complexes that contain retail on the bottom. The thought being, that this would increase the safety of Aurora while helping to soften our current housing crises. The appeal comes as \"Greenlake\" Self-storage continues its construction just a few blocks south. The hearing for the appeal is set for 9 AM on Monday, Aug. 13, at the City of Seattle Hearing Examiner's Office, Seattle Municipal Tower, 700 5th Ave., 40th Floor. Hearings are open to the public, but generally only those who are parties to the appeal and persons called by the parties as witnesses will have the opportunity to testify. A person who has not appealed, but who has a substantial interest in the outcome of the appeal, may request to be allowed to participate in an appeal as an \"intervenor\". An intervenor, like the parties, would have the option of appealing the Hearing Examiner's decision in this matter. Intervenor status should be requested as soon as possible prior to hearing and in accordance with the Hearing Examiner Rules. For information regarding appeals and intervenor status, contact or visit the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner's office provides barrier-free access. The reason for the appeal reflects the concerns shared by many: My interest is to maintain some sense of residential and environmental neighborhood atmosphere. This project unfortunately has been grandfathered into the rezoning of past. The current rezoning would not support this project.

Of course, one-day several months ago, this duo came to an end, leaving only Total Wine - which sits at the bottom of an apartment complex, left in-tact. A friend of the blog recently reached out to us, with an unsurprising explanation for that closure: BevMo!, which was nestled into an old-fashioned shopping strip, needed to close to make way for the expansion of Downtown Northgate. In the place of the old shopping plaza, plans are in place to build a 235 unit apartment building with retail at the bottom, continuing the trend happening around the old plaza: If you would like to give your input into the design of this new apartment building, there is an upcoming opportunity to contribute to the early design guidance August 6, 2018 6:30 pm Meanwhile, the redevelopment of the mall into the focal point of this new downtown area continues being planned, with the first two opportunities for community input coming tentatively next month: August 13, 2018 6:30 pm August 27, 2018 6:30 pm The transit-oriented development, temporarily paused, has come back in full swing with a new RFP based on free land from King County and an upzone to allow up to 24 story buildings promised by the end of this month .

Licton Springs is no exception, and we are lucky to have at least 4 Teriyaki places within our < 1 square mile neighborhood. With so many to choose from it can be difficult to know which one to try out. So, we decided to make the only logical decision and try all 4! The methodology For this taste test we decided to go with the plain Teriyaki Chicken dish from all 4 locations. We took turns with a blindfold on while the other randomly gave us a taste of one of the Teriyaki dishes and asked for a score from 1-5. We didn't include cost in our calculation since all 4 Teriyaki places had their Teriyaki priced within a few dimes of each other in the $8 range. NOTE: Many of them also have lunch specials for around $7. The contenders Manna Deli Teriyaki Conveniently located on Aurora and with very friendly service, this Teriyaki place currently enjoys the highest rating of the 3 Teriyaki only restaurants on Yelp, but unfortunately had the lowest health rating at the time we went. Address: 9831 Aurora Ave N Seattle, WA 98103 Hours: 11AM-9PM Monday-Saturday, Closed Sunday Current Health Rating: Okay Oak Tree Teriyaki Located in the Oak Tree Plaza, right near the recently remodeled AMC (easily one of the comfiest theaters in Seattle now), this has long been my favorite Teriyaki place. The owner is super friendly, they have these excellent house fries, and they have hours that work pretty well for eating before or after movies. However, I always get the Spicy Teriyaki here, so I'm curious to see how the regular Teriyaki fares. Address: 10002 Aurora Ave N, Seattle, WA 98133 Hours: 11AM-9PM Monday-Saturday, Closed Sunday Current Health Rating: Good Teriyaki Plus The only Teriyaki place of the 4 that neither of us had been to before, so we are both stoked to try it out for the first time. Address: 2100 N Northgate Way b, Seattle, WA 98133 Hours: 11AM-9PM Monday-Saturday, Closed Sunday Current Health Rating: Excellent Cafe Banh Mi Tucked away in a business complex on Meridian Ave, Cafe Banh Mi is the only place we tried that isn't marketed as a Teriyaki restaurant. It does, however, happen to have Teriyaki permanently on the menu. We discovered this when traveling back to Seattle on an early morning flight. We missed Seattle Teriyaki so much on our vacation - that we craved it upon returning. Cafe Banh Mi was the only place that served Teriyaki we could find that was also open at 8 AM. However, their matching early close time and non-existent weekend hours mean we don't get to enjoy this place nearly as often as we'd like to. Address: 10700 Meridian Ave N #106, Seattle, WA 98133 Hours: 7AM-5PM Monday-Friday, Closed Saturday & Sunday Current Health Rating: Excellent The ratings Cafe Banh Mi With a generous coating of Teriyaki glaze covering perfectly moist chicken, Cafe Banh Mi easily took the #1 spot. Amanda: 4.5 - \"Delicious. I want more.\" Tim: 4.5 - \"By far the best.\" Oak Tree Teriyaki Oak Tree's distinctive crunch helped pull it into #2 place. And then there are those glorious house fries... Amanda: 3.75 Tim 4.0 - \"Has a really nice crunch to it.\" Bonus (House Fries): Amanda: 5.0 - \"This isn't what we are taste testing, but these are delicious.\" Tim: 10 - \"That's right, these are off the scale. It's a good thing these aren't included in the actual rating.\" Manna Deli Teriyaki Amanda: 3.5 - \"Has a nice flavor to it, but I want a bit more.\" Tim 3.25 Teriyaki Plus Some more teriyaki sauce may have made all the difference for this one. Amanda: 3.25 - \"Too Dry.\" Tim 3.0 - \"Too Dry!\" Disagree with our ratings? Let us know why in the comments! Either way, go eat some delicious Teriyaki in Licton Springs!","tags":"Restaurants","url":"https://lovelicton.com/teriyaki-taste-test-2018.html"},{"title":"The Original Seattle Real Estate Gold Rush","text":"A friend of the blog lent us a historical pamphlet from when Licton Springs was first being developed that I thought was too cool not to share.

This next Tuesday (the 19th, a week and some change from now) at 6:30 PM we will be holding our first beginner's disc golf game, with help from members of the local disc golf community. At this event, you will not only be able to learn how to play alongside other beginners but will also be able to receive valuable tips from some more veteran disc golf players. This event will be held at Mineral Springs park, located on the north end of Licton Springs. This course takes the honor of being the original and only Disc Golf course in Seattle proper. Being a city course it also has a more compact intricate design making it uniquely well suited to learning disc golf technique. Having never Disc Golfed ourselves, my wife and I went by the course this morning to get some sense of the game. In the course, we were struck by not only the beauty and tranquillity of a course nestled in the city but also by the friendliness of disc golfers. We ran into Mary and Tony who took us through both some of the basics of Disc Golf and the unique traits of this course. There are poles throughout the course used to hold up netting that separates pathways and different sections of the course. They told us that every time your disc hits one of those poles and makes a little ringing sound, it's called North Park Love. Hope to enjoy the summer weather, learn how to Disc Golf, and ring in some North Park Love with some of you there!

Regardless what your thoughts are on the overall legislation, I encourage you to let our council members know what we as a community want from Aurora. For me that means more gems like the wonderful neighborhood shops that fill Oak Tree Plaza and fewer storage facilities. Either way, as the final public hearing happens tomorrow (June 5th) this may be your last opportunity to let the council know how you feel. From our friends at ALUV : Dear ALUV Friends and Neighbors, Thank you for continued interest in bringing positive change to the Aurora Ave Corridor, specifically from N. 84th to N. 110th. As we continue our efforts to increase public safety via \"eyes on the street\" our biggest obstacle is the commercial zoning designation. This zoning has recently allowed for two public storage facilities to be built that provide no housing or walkable amenities to our Residential Urban Village as designated by the city in 1999. Please email your support for the proposed zoning changes from Commercial (C) to Neighborhood Commercial (NC) to the Seattle City Council council@seattle.gov prior to JUNE 5th. -> Click here for the email template from ALUV .","tags":"Aurora","url":"https://lovelicton.com/the-time-to-rezone-aurora-is-now.html"},{"title":"Aurora is getting cleaned up.","text":"The next time you walk or ride up Aurora you may notice it's cleaner than usual. In more ways than one, positive changes are starting to take hold on this historical Seattle Avenue. The city's proactive litter abatement pilot program has added Licton Spring's stretch of Aurora to its 2x weekly cleanup. This brave crew cleans up everything from coffee cups to used syringes, hopefully helping to encourage a sustainably clean street over time. At the same time, SPD and Licton Spring's own North Precinct have been hard at work to bust a local pawn shop that incentivised theft within North Seattle. Along with the closure of the business, this had the side effect of finally permanently removing an Aurora fixture that we will all be happy to see go: (See more on the spdblotter ) Finally, Aurora is going to be repaved and sidewalk ramps made ADA compliant over the next year . Which, while sure to be an inconvenience during construction and lacking the sidewalk improvements Aurora desperately needs , will hopefully be worth it upon completion as it plays a part in increasing road safety and accessibility. While more work is needed along this historic stretch of Seattle, it's encouraging that we are starting to see progress toward an Aurora that we can all take pride in.","tags":"Aurora","url":"https://lovelicton.com/aurora-is-getting-cleaned-up.html"},{"title":"Local Licton Pet Highlight - A Famous Licton Springs Resident","text":"An anonymous reader of LoveLicton let us know about a celebrity living right here in Licton Springs: The \"tuxedo\" cat, Henry, known by his stage name, Henri, Le Chat Noir, is a resident of our neighborhood, though he lives in quiet obscurity, not troubled by his You-Tube fame.

The circle will be a very welcome addition to the area, as, despite lots of warning signs and kids, sees more than its fair share of speeding. This new circle will complement the existing one at N 95th, hopefully reducing speed driving up Wallingford. On my walk up to N 97th, I also noticed initials outlines for a continuation of the N 92nd bike path by the new School.

So, when I was told the Licton Springs location had closed, I feared the worse. Rushing to the restaurant after work, I was greeted not by Tropicos Breeze, but by El Patio. What a quick transformation! Entering El Patio, I saw familiar faces and after talking to the staff learned what had taken place. The Licton Spring's Tropicos Breeze location was sold to the owner's cousin. The new restaurant, I was told, retains the same staff and great quality food we have come to love. I ordered Pollo en Crema and Horchata - two of my favorite standbys from the old Tropicos Breeze. You know, just to make sure I was told the truth... And I can happily confirm: the food here is as tasty as ever!

Did you know that Licton Springs has a community p-patch at College Way & North 92nd St? What is a P-Patch? P-Patch is the name given to community gardens that are managed by the Seattle P-Patch Community Gardening Program. The P-Patch program oversees 88 P-Patches over 32 acres throughout the city. Though a P-Patch, neighbors can come together to plan, plant, and grow community. What is the history of Licton Spring's P-Patch? The Licton Springs P-Patch dates back to 1976 as a student-driven initiative at North Seattle College. While the original community garden ended up as a school parking lot, in 2013 the North Seattle College Sustainability Committee revived the initiative. After over a year of hard work from the community digging up land, building plots, and adding compost, a community garden of 67 plots and 15,000 sq ft was developed in Licton Springs! How can I get involved? For information about volunteering, events, and general p-patch activities, email lictonspringsppatch@gmail.com or visit the community website at www.lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle . The next community work party will be on Sunday, 4/15 from 11am to 1pm at the garden. The next leadership meeting will be on the first Wednesday of May (5/2) at 6pm at the OCEE building room 229 on North Seattle College campus.","tags":"Parks","url":"https://lovelicton.com/licton-springs-ppatch-2018.html"},{"title":"Want to be involved in the Licton Springs Community?","text":"Want to stay up to date on all the community events and meetings going on in Licton Springs and surrounding areas?

It already has relatively high side-walk coverage and population density for the North Seattle area. It is also full of pro-growth and housing community groups - with no noticeable Nimby presence. And, with the light rail approaching in a few more years, it appears the community will be well positioned to take on the growth it desires. The neighbourhood has been seeing additional improvements planned and completed at an unprecedented pace. It's hard just to keep track of all the projects going on! To try and make it a bit easier: I've gone ahead and taken inventory of all the projects I'm aware of and mapped them out by location, start time, and end time. Did I miss anything?

However, the best place to catch a glimpse of the local duck population in Seattle is right here in Licton Springs. Located on N 90th St between Densmore and Ashworth Ave N and near the new school: Pilling's Pond remains as a reminder of Chuck Pilling's legacy. This is the spot where he became the first successful breeder of the hooded merganser, bufflehead and harlequin ducks. Here you can still find hundreds of ducks enjoying the pond. While there has been some concern about the future of the pond due to a sale, the new owners have expressed their desire to keep the legacy going and have allowed Dave Kunkle to continue the maintenance of this great North Seattle landmark. NOTE: You can't enter the pond but can safely view the ducks from behind the wired fence.

The new design decreases costs and the maximum slope while improving visibility and addressing the concerns of North Seattle College. The project has secured all necessary funding contingent on it being complete before the light rail opens. It will take 10-15 minutes to walk from the base of the bridge to the entrance of the transit center. The bridge will incorporate scenic overlooks and art installation(s). There is no bike/pedestrian or direction lane separation planned for the bridge. Instead, users will be expected to utilize the generously wide (16ft) path to follow standard right of way rules. Additionally, visual and tactile cues will be added near mixing areas, transition zones, and overlooks providing helpful cues to bicyclists. VIA Architecture expressed pride in their work to create an affordable design that will still be an enjoyable experience to walk over, highlight the beauty inherit on both sides of I5, and act as another North Seattle landmark. Talking with Eric from VIA Architecture, I learned that they use VR to verify what a realistic experience of their designs will be once built. I also learned about a ton of other exciting things planned for Licton Springs and the surrounding area that will be rolling out over the next few years.
