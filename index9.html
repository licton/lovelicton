                <p>If you are as excited about the ongoing art project on the Aurora Pedestrian Bridge <a href="https://lovelicton.com/vibrant-art-aurora-2018.html">as we are</a>, you will be thrilled to hear there is now an opportunity to meet neighbors and help enhance the project!
This coming weekend (Saturday the 17th and Sunday the 18th), neighbors will be meeting 10:00am-4:00pm to prepare the soil and then plant over 3 thousand daffodil bulbs.</p>
<p><a href="/images/aurora/bulbs.png"><img alt="Daffodils" src="/images/aurora/bulbs.png"></a></p>
<p>The project will be completed in two steps, first preparing the soil on Saturday and then planting on Sunday:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2473996325974293/">Aurora Bridge Art Installation - Daffodil Planting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Wear heavy gloves and yard shoes. Bring your own planting tools: shovels, trowels, hand clippers (for cutting ivy roots). Rain gear if it is wet!</p>
<p>You can find out more on <a href="http://auroralictonuv.org/2018/11/11/community-planting-project-nov-17th-18th/?fbclid=IwAR21ZzkUQRsPudMdVgRaOGrYX40KfUZhe6_Ew9HjS9ALPP1xlt_xyhRbfhg">ALUV's website</a>, who first alerted us to this community project.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

                <p>Well ahead of the light rail opening, many changes are coming to Northgate Transit Center, some over the next few weeks, and others early next year.</p>
<p>Back in September, we saw our first positive change as the <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/elected/executive/constantine/news/release/2018/July/25-metro-service-amazon-seattle.aspx">41 bus received more frequent service</a>. However, as Seattle prepares for the <a href="http://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2018/09/07/seattles-transportation-new-normal-is-just-around-the-corner/">period of maximum constraint</a> early next year,
you can expect even more changes to come to our transit station.</p>
<p>The first major change coming is the opening of the new parking garage to the north of the station, coinciding with the close of the 2 west side lots:</p>
<p><a href="images/northgate/parking.jpg"><img alt="New Parking Setup" src="images/northgate/parking.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The new parking garage will contain 450 parking spots, more than making up for the closed lots, <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/want-to-park-at-the-northgate-park-and-ride-it-might-cost-you-125-per-month">but some of the new spots will be reserved for paying customers</a>.
More information about the parking changes can be found <a href="https://m.soundtransit.org/northgatestation/northgate-transit-center-park-and-ride">on Sound Transit's overview</a>.
These changes will take effect Monday, November 19th.</p>
<p>Then, come March of next year, <a href="https://m.soundtransit.org/Projects-and-Plans/service-planning/service-implementation-plan">big changes are planned for our fastest connection to Bellevue - the 555</a>. The route will be updated to bypass Montlake and operate only between Northgate and Bellevue, no longer serving Eastgate or Issaquah.
This should result in much quicker and dependable transit times for those commuting between Licton Springs and Downtown Bellevue.</p>
<p>Finally, with land usage signs now visible around the North Seattle College's Campus, construction on the pedestrian bridge from Licton Springs to the transit center has passed its biggest hurdles and is set to begin construction next year.</p>
<p>Here's to hoping all the transit changes lead to a quicker more dependable commute!</p>

                <p>We've just been given news we couldn't be happier to report:</p>
<p>Pilgrim Coffee is coming to Oak Tree plaza!</p>
<p><a href="/images/pilgrim/poster.jpg"><img alt="Poster" src="/images/pilgrim/poster.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Starting tomorrow Pilgrim Coffee will be operating at 10002 Aurora Ave N Monday - Wednesday 7-10 AM, and we've heard rumors that if demand is high enough they may expand their hours next month.</p>
<p>It's been a little less than two months since <a href="https://lovelicton.com/original_north_seattle_starbucks_closing.html">Starbucks left Licton Spring's urban village</a>, leaving the area without any coffee options.
Tomorrow that all changes. While many would have been content with almost any Coffee Shop setting up at the location, we couldn't be more ecstatic that our favorite Coffee Truck
is setting up right in front of the old Starbucks. We've been a fan of Pilgrim Coffee for a while, as they've roasted some great coffee right here in the neighborhood:</p>
<p><a href="/images/pilgrim/roasts.jpg"><img alt="Roasts" src="/images/pilgrim/roasts.jpg"></a></p>
<p>It also doesn't hurt that the opening happens at the perfect time for holiday-inspired drinks:</p>
<p><a href="/images/pilgrim/holiday_drinks.jpg"><img alt="Holiday Drink Specials" src="/images/pilgrim/holiday_drinks.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We hope you will join us drinking some great local coffee!</p>

                <p>Where College Way N and Meridian Ave N meet in Licton Springs there is a small police station. That station is responsible for serving all of North Seattle. From Ballard to UDistrict, Fremont to Haller Lake, all of them are served by the North Precinct. This easily makes it the station that serves both the largest land area and population.</p>

<p>Naturally, this has led for many calls to split the precinct, or most recently, replace it with a new much larger location (on Aurora). However, thus far, there hasn't been political alignment to turn these calls into reality. The most recent of which was stopped by a counter campaign to <a href="http://council.seattle.gov/2016/09/16/sawant-block-the-bunker-activists-to-celebrate-victory-on-north-precinct-call-to-use-funds-for-housing/">"Block the Bunker"</a>, primarily driven from those who live in areas that aren't in the area served by the precinct they wish to block.</p>
<p>Now, if you walk by the precinct, you will be greeted by many land use signs. The North Precinct plans to increase its footprint at its current location.</p>

<p>Where grass and greenery used to be, <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/NorthPrecinctStation/NorthPrecinctFlyer.pdf">the precinct plans to pave additional parking and add portables</a>.
The plan isn't meant to be a permanent solution, but the hope is it will enable the precinct to keep up with the next 5-7 years of growth.
And while there is concern by many over the loss of greenspace as <a href="http://web6.seattle.gov/dpd/edms/">illustrated in the public comments</a> (record # 3031508-LU), with no other agreed on options,
combined with an increasing call for greater public safety and police presence, it seems increasingly likely that we will see the start of an expanded precinct in Licton Springs come this time next year.</p>
