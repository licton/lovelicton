This change is happening thanks to a partnership between Amazon, the City of Seattle, and King County Metro. This will be a particularly welcome addition over the next few years as the <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/metros-convention-place-station-closing-saturday-for-good">recent closure of the Convention Place Station</a> reroutes our other popular bus line into downtown: the 41 - leading to possible delays until the light rail construction is complete.</p>

<p>This change will positively affect many as the E Line is Metro’s highest-ridership route with more than 17,000 weekday riders.</p>

                <p>Whether you call it Licton Springs, North Green Lake, North College Park, or that magical portal in-between Green Lake, Greenwood, and the Northgate mall - we are all proud to call it home. And, apparently, according to a new report from Redfin, we are not the only ones who would like to do so. Licton Springs showed up on <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/redfins-new-compete-score-ranks-markets-based-competition-homes-seattle-toughest/">Redfin's report</a> as the #1 most competitive neighborhood to buy into, in not only Seattle, but the entire United States.</p>

<p>We tied with ourselves (under the name North College Park, yep we are in the report twice) and 5 other neighborhoods including nearby Phinney Ridge for the spot. Having also received a property taxable value reassessment notice today, I'm not entirely sure it's a placement any of us were looking to achieve...</p>

                <p>A friend of the blog wrote in to let us know the construction of the North Seattle Neighborhood Greenway project down 100th Ave N is set to begin as soon as tomorrow.
The project aims to connect Crown Hill, Greenwood, and Licton Springs both to each other and to the upcoming pedestrian bridge that will provide direct access to the Northgate light rail station. While the entire project, which will stretch around 2 miles, is a welcome addition - of particular interest to those in the Licton Springs area are a <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/Greenways/N100thStFactsheet.pdf">new sidewalk from Linden Ave N to Aurora Ave N</a> and sidewalk improvements being made between Aurora Ave N and Stone Ave N.</p>
<p><a href="images/2018_greenway/banner.jpg"><img alt="Linden currently without sidewalk" src="images/2018_greenway/banner.jpg"></a>

<a href="images/2018_greenway/greenway_area.jpg"><img alt="100th in Licton Springs" src="images/2018_greenway/greenway_area.jpg"></a></p>
<p>When the work is complete, the hope is that it will be possible to safely walk or ride a bicycle all the way from Crown Hill to the new light rail station, with sidewalk at a  minimum from Linden Ave N eastward. You can find more information about the project on <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/greenways-program/north-seattle">SDOT's overview page</a>. The project should take around 6 months to complete with individual neighbors being directly contacted as construction work that impacts them is underway.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the traffic circle on Wallingford Ave N and N 97th <a href="https://lovelicton.com/street_improvements_preview_2018.html">we wrote about earlier this year</a> has now been completed and is just awaiting greenery.</p>
<p><a href="images/2018_greenway/circle.jpg"><img alt="Wallingford Ave N Circle" src="images/2018_greenway/circle.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We look forward to a safer and more walkable North Seattle!</p>

                <p>A member of the community has come forth to formally appeal the development of the old Gold's Gym location, which helped compliment other nearby business such as Emerald City Smoothie, into a storage facility. The area in question has a moratorium on non-pedestrian oriented businesses, but the permit for the storage facility was placed right before it was put into effect. Beyond Aurora, the property is surrounded by homes and townhouses, and there is a strong desire by many within the area to increase housing and retail along Aurora, by lining it with apartment complexes that contain retail on the bottom. The thought being, that this would increase the safety of Aurora while helping to soften our current housing crises.</p>

<a href="/images/golds_gym/houses_behind_gym.jpg"><img alt="Houses behind gym" src="/images/golds_gym/houses_behind_gym.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The appeal comes as "Greenlake" Self-storage continues its construction just a few blocks south.</p>
<p><a href="/images/golds_gym/greenlake.jpg"><img alt="Greenlake Self-Storage" src="/images/golds_gym/greenlake.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The hearing for the appeal is set for 9 AM on Monday, Aug. 13, at the City of Seattle Hearing Examiner’s Office, Seattle Municipal Tower, 700 5th Ave., 40th Floor. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hearings are open to the public, but generally only those who are parties to the appeal and persons called by the parties as witnesses will have the opportunity to testify. A person who has not appealed, but who has a substantial interest in the outcome of the appeal, may request to be allowed to participate in an appeal as an “intervenor”. An intervenor, like the parties, would have the option of appealing the Hearing Examiner’s decision in this matter. Intervenor status should be requested as soon as possible prior to hearing and in accordance with the Hearing Examiner Rules. For information regarding appeals and intervenor status, contact or visit the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner’s office provides barrier-free access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for the appeal reflects the concerns shared by many:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My interest is to maintain some sense of residential and environmental
neighborhood atmosphere. This project unfortunately has been grandfathered into the rezoning of
past. The current rezoning would not support this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the full reasoning behind the appeal as well as all supporting documents on <a href="https://web6.seattle.gov/Examiner/case/MUP-18-015">Seattle's Hearing Examiner site</a>.</p>

                <p>For many years Northgate enjoyed the convenience of having both of the big name wine and beer outlets right next to each other.
Being able to easily walk between BevMo! and Total Wine in the same trip was a magical thing for anyone who anxiously awaited limited availability beer, wine, or spirit releases.
Of course, one-day several months ago, this duo came to an end, leaving only Total Wine - which sits at the bottom of an apartment complex, left in-tact.</p>
<p>A friend of the blog recently reached out to us, with an unsurprising explanation for that closure: BevMo!, which was nestled into an old-fashioned shopping strip, needed to close to make way for the expansion of Downtown Northgate. In the place of the old shopping plaza, plans are in place to build a 235 unit apartment building with retail at the bottom, continuing the trend happening around the old plaza:</p>
<p><a href="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"><img alt="Old BevMo! Location" src="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"></a>

<a href="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"><img alt="Alleyway showing grouping of mid-rises" src="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"></a></p>
<p>If you would like to give your input into the design of this new apartment building, there is an upcoming opportunity to contribute to the early design guidance <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6936">August 6, 2018 6:30 pm</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the redevelopment of the mall into the focal point of this new downtown area continues being planned, with the first two opportunities for community input coming tentatively next month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6930">August 13, 2018 6:30 pm</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6931">August 27, 2018 6:30 pm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The transit-oriented development, temporarily paused, has come back in full swing with a new RFP based on free land from King County and an upzone to allow up to 24 story buildings <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/king-county-moves-to-allow-affordable-housing-at-future-northgate-light-rail-station/">promised by the end of this month</a>.</p>
<p>And finally, concerns over future of the Northgate Pedestrian bridge which will connect Licton Springs directly to both the developing Light Rail and Downtown Northgate, have been alleviated after the <a href="https://cascade.org/blog/2018/06/bridge-92-northgate-biking-and-walking-bridge-moving-forward">Seattle Colleges Board of Trustees conditionally agreed to give an easement to the new bridge</a>. The latest plans for which, will have the new bridge/path only a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/47.7015386,-122.3422173/47.7014736,-122.335324/@47.7008021,-122.3419329,16z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2">~5-10 minute walk away from Oak Tree Plaza</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/images/downtown_northgate/bridge.png"><img alt="New Bridge" src="/images/downtown_northgate/bridge.png"></a></p>
<p>No matter how you feel about the developments overall, hopefully, this all will lead to a North Seattle that feels more connected both to Downtown Seattle and to the neighborhoods contained within.</p>
