                <h2>Help Prioritize Neighborhood Street Fund Projects</h2>
<p>Community members have submitted over 300 projects for the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/neighborhood-street-fund">Neighborhood Street Fund</a> and now it is time for community prioritization of the initiatives.

<ul>
<li>Improvements to help make Licton Springs more connected to Green Lake at N 85TH, including improving the <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-114?results=true">Wallingford Ave N crosswalk</a> (#2019-114) and the <a href="https://nsf.consider.it/2019-25?results=true">Ashworth Ave N intersection</a> (#2019-25). These projects are listed as part of District 6 but would benefit both District 5 and District 6.</li>
