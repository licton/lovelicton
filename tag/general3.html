                <h2>Your Voice, Your Choice Ideas Due March 18th</h2>
<p>Now’s your chance to share ideas for small-scale park and street improvements in your neighborhood during Your Voice, Your Choice 2020. Seattle Department of Neighborhoods is asking community members to democratically decide how to spend $2 million of the City’s budget on these improvements.</p>
<p>From February 18 to March 18, community members age 11 and up (13 and up to participate online) who live, work, go to school,  receive services, or participate in activities in Seattle can <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/your-voice-your-choice/get-involved/idea-collection">submit their idea online</a> or in-person at any Seattle Public Library branch. Projects could include park benches, trail improvements, marked crosswalks, and sidewalk repair, to name a few. The only criteria are the project ideas focus on physical improvements to Seattle’s parks or streets, benefit the public, and cost $150,000 or less.</p>
<p>Once ideas are submitted, volunteers are recruited to turn the ideas into 8 – 10 proposals per council district. Then this summer, everyone will have the opportunity to vote for the top projects within their district. Of the $2 million budget, approximately $185,00 is allocated to each council district. The remaining funds are allocated to projects in underrepresented communities or Equity and Environment Initiative (EEI) Focus Areas. </p>
<p>Share your ideas today! You can learn more about the YVYC process and how to get involved <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/neighborhoods/programs-and-services/your-voice-your-choice">here</a>. For questions, email shaquan.smith@seattle.gov or call 206-256-5944.</p>
<p>Greenwood-Phinney Greenways will be hosting a community idea gathering event for YVYC @ their regular meeting on Tuesday March 10, 2020  at 7:30PM. This meeting will be held virtually via Zoom. Meeting ID: 695 749 283

                <p>Several Licton Springs Community Council board members stopped by the Northgate Ped/Bike Bridge Project Information Session held at North Seattle College on January 7th to learn more about construction efforts. </p>
<p>We are excited to share that the construction is approved to begin today, January 27, 2020. The bridge will connect NE 100th Ave and 1st Ave NE &amp; NE 100th, near the future light rail station in Northgate. </p>
<p><a href="/images/ngatebridgeproject.JPG"><img alt="Map" src="/images/ngatebridgeproject.JPG"></a></p>
<p>Quick facts about the new bridge:</p>
<p>•   When complete, the bridge will be 1,900 feet long. <br>
•   West approach designed to maintain sightlines and preserve natural habitat <br>
•   East approach designed to preserve parking<br>
•   Only a 10-minute walk from one side to the other<br>
•   1,500 anticipated users per day<br>
•   16 feet wide<br>
•   Estimated construction completion in Fall 2021<br>
•   Typical construction hours are weekdays, 7am – 5pm<br>
•   Occasional weekends and night work will occur<br>
•   2 freeway closures, on weekends and at night only, with detours<br>
•   Temporary full closure of the North Seattle Park &amp; Ride on 1st Ave NE<br>
•   Trail closures on the North Seattle College campus<br></p>
<p>The first phase of construction over the next several months will focus on clearing vegetation, preparing watercourse work, drilling bridge shafts, and constructing girders for the bridge spans which happens offsite. As neighbors to the project, we can expect to see large machinery, dust, noise, debris, and traffic impacts from lane closures and shifts. </p>

At the event, you’ll hear from District 5 Councilmember Debora Juarez, Seattle Department of Transportation Director Sam Zimbabwe, Sound Transit CEO Peter Rogoff, and representatives from Washington State Department of Transportation and key community groups.
