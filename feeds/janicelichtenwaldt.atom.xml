This is especially true of live music, a cornerstone of modern-day Seattle. Live music has the power to bring communities together, to fill the heart with joy, and spread happiness. And that is what we hope to do on August 19, from 5pm - 7pm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Licton Springs Community Council, in partnership with the City of Seattle, are offering a small bright spot to your day. On Wednesday, August 19th from 5pm - 7pm, local solo musicians will stroll through the streets of Licton Springs to provide an outdoor concert. Pull up a lawn chair or picnic blanket, grab some snacks and enjoy the free moving neighborhood concert. Please remember to wear your masks and keep 6ft between you and non-family members.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also raising funds by selling neighborhood t-shirts to help celebrate the designation of Licton Springs or líq’tәd, the area’s traditional name, as an official City of Seattle Landmark. This designation recognizes and celebrates Licton Springs / líq’tәd as a sacred site to the Duwamish people and other indeginous groups of the Pacific Northwest. The Licton Springs Community Council fully supported this designation and was working in partnership with UNEA and ClearSky Youth program to host a large celebration for this summer but, of course, plans changed. We will celebrate this designation at some point when gatherings are allowed again. Funds raised will support such future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shirts feature the original name of Licton Springs: líq’tәd. líq’tәd means Red-Paint in Puget Sound’s Lushootseed language. We sought out and received approval to use the Lushootseed word in our efforts to educate the larger community about the rich history of our neighborhood. You can purchase your t-shirt at: https://www.zazzle.com/store/licton_springs_cc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to share that the construction is approved to begin today, January 27, 2020. The bridge will connect NE 100th Ave and 1st Ave NE &amp;amp; NE 100th, near the future light rail station in Northgate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/ngatebridgeproject.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="Map" src="/images/ngatebridgeproject.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick facts about the new bridge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•   When complete, the bridge will be 1,900 feet long. &lt;br&gt;
•   West approach designed to maintain sightlines and preserve natural habitat &lt;br&gt;
•   East approach designed to preserve parking&lt;br&gt;
•   Only a 10-minute walk from one side to the other&lt;br&gt;
•   1,500 anticipated users per day&lt;br&gt;
•   16 feet wide&lt;br&gt;
•   Estimated construction completion in Fall 2021&lt;br&gt;
•   Typical construction hours are weekdays, 7am – 5pm&lt;br&gt;
•   Occasional weekends and night work will occur&lt;br&gt;
•   2 freeway closures, on weekends and at night only, with detours&lt;br&gt;
•   Temporary full closure of the North Seattle Park &amp;amp; Ride on 1st Ave NE&lt;br&gt;
•   Trail closures on the North Seattle College campus&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase of construction over the next several months will focus on clearing vegetation, preparing watercourse work, drilling bridge shafts, and constructing girders for the bridge spans which happens offsite. As neighbors to the project, we can expect to see large machinery, dust, noise, debris, and traffic impacts from lane closures and shifts. &lt;/p&gt;
