Since that time we've met so many wonderful neighbors and inspiring community groups.
We've helped to host countless events, and joined all of you to fight for causes important for our neighborhood.
We couldn't feel more lucky to be a part of this community and hope to continue to do our part to keep it a great place to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this is the first of many years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're neighbors,&lt;/p&gt;
