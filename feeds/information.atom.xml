&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/homezone/meeting.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Home Zone meeting draws in community" src="/images/homezone/meeting.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief introduction about the desire of the pilot and the inherent limitations due to a small budget size, neighbors split up into groups to separately tackle traffic calming, community art, and wayfinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting the following existing areas of concern were identified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant and fast cut-through traffic through both Meridian and Corliss which, combined with lack of sidewalks, causes an impediment to pedestrian activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast traffic is coming down the hill from 90th and Meridian to 90th and Burke. This area already has a lot of pedestrian activity, but speed combined with the lack of a safe intersection has already led to a collision and many near collisions with both pedestrians and other vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-ideal crossing conditions at 90th and Wallingford. A child who attended the meeting shared their story of near collision occurring just a few days prior. Other areas near the school have flashing pedestrian signs, but this intersection lacks them.
Proposal being explained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/homezone/explain.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Proposal being explained" src="/images/homezone/explain.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, there was also concern expressed around a previous proposal to close Meridian off at 92nd with a "Do Not Enter" sign. Much of the concern centered around the fact that closing off the street could move the traffic onto other roads, in particular, Corliss, while not addressing walkability. This lined up well with much of the Anonymous feedback we received from our online &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAtYcX8J4IQE_agDKW45oXHEvzt0LaOTQ1lImnO8CdkqSScg/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;amp;entry.1991292058=Yes"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't understand the problem this is fixing. Closing Meridian does nothing for the 90th Street Burke hill, through which half the neighborhood drains out,
 will make the backup at 92nd &amp;amp; College worse, while causing daily irritation and delay for the other half of the neighborhood in getting home (or causing
 them to speed down the hill on 90th north of Meridian, too). Traffic calming on the Burke hill I'm all in favor of, but don't understand the benefit for the
rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to the current proposal, at 92nd and Meridian I would prefer that it be a "local access only" sign instead of a one-way street / do not enter
sign.
I like the idea for the street planters, stop signs, speed bump at 90th and burke, and the street art at 88th and burke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Greenwood traffic calming maze is a nightmare. What do the residents over there think about having to drive many more blocks to get where they want or the increased east/west traffic down their formerly quiet residential streets?
So I am skeptical about the proposed Home Pilot Program. The plan that the people living at the north end of Meridian to get home from College Way now,
instead of a left turn, one block, right turn and into driveway, will be making a right turn, one block, stop, left turn 2 blocks, stop, left turn 2 blocks
stop, left turn, weave among planters and finally home. Also, since I live on Corliss, I'm not happy at the prospect of increased traffic from cars trying to
get to Meridian from the East. There are a LOT of pedestrians, (students, elderly, young families, dog walkers) that use our sidewalk-less street. I plan to
make a count on a weekday to corroborate that statement. Are not the proposals to close off access to 85th at Meridian and put a stop sign at 90th sufficient to really cut down traffic volumes and speed?
A Local Access Only sign at 92nd and Corliss is fairly meaningless.
I hope you put the walking sign at the corner of the school grounds and not in someone's front yard.
The speed bump crosswalk at N. 90th and Burke is fine if it is something the people in the houses at that corner feel is necessary. It is a residential
intersection at the bottom of a steep hill with parked cars often making progress to Wallingford slow anyway. Cars SHOULD be crawling there.
As for the proposed art, no comment until I see what and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like many of the ideas (stop signs and planters on Meridian Ave N), with the exception of blocking southbound access to Meridian Ave N at N 92nd street.
The reason for not preferring this option is that in wintertime during snow conditions southbound access provides a safer route home (avoiding steep hills)
and that blocking access would lengthen the drive through residential neighborhoods to get to my home.  My observation is that most of the problem with fast
cars driving through the neighborhood in the morning is due to northbound cars (not southbound cars). Thanks for your consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussion, the community seemed to coalesce around the idea of working to limit speed on both Meridian and Corliss with inexpensive traffic calming measures, rather than entirely block access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many ideas were brought up to increase the walkability of the area including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intersection art at 90th and Burke Ave N. The hope is that this would clearly mark the intersection encouraging vehicles to slow down and yield for pedestrians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wayfinding signs in various forms throughout the neighborhood.
&lt;a href="/images/homezone/wayfinding.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wayfinding signs" src="/images/homezone/wayfinding.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic calming measures, such as strategically placed planters and/or chicanes, evenly applied on both Meridian and Corliss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up a weekly &lt;a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/public-space-management-programs/play-streets"&gt;play street&lt;/a&gt; on one of the unsidewalked blocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pedestrian activated crosswalk on 90th and Wallingford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the immediate next steps focused on art and wayfinding as traffic calming requires permit approval from SDOT and will take more time to put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

Home Zones represent an innovative and inexpensive approach to increasing walkability, safety, and the sense of community in neighborhoods that lack full sidewalk coverage. The pilot will cover the area north of 85TH, south of 92ND, west of I5 and east of Wallingford Ave. N Below is a map of the area, as well as some of the ideas that have already been proposed for the pilot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1D2yvYJGKPqQ2Sl-n9U1dxqXP5VucpecC" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area was chosen, in particular, because it represents a small well-defined area in which to prove out the concept. If the pilot is successful: it could be expanded both to other areas in Licton Springs and throughout greater North Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are home zones something to get excited about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is known by many that Seattle has a sidewalk, or rather lack thereof, problem.
As shown in this map prepared by SDOT in 2015, over a quarter of Seattle is laking sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/homezone/sidewalk_coverage.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sidewalk Coverage" src="/images/homezone/sidewalk_coverage.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the need is concentrated in North Seattle, predominantly north of N 85th. And while Licton Springs is lucky to have the best sidewalk coverage of any neighborhood this far North, it still has less sidewalk coverage than any of the communities immediately to the south of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an often repeated claim that Seattle promised all these areas sidewalk when they were annexed so many decades ago. And, while I haven't definitively been able to determine if &lt;a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/local/transportation/article/Getting-There-Did-the-city-promise-sidewalks-to-886368.php"&gt;that claim is fact or folklore&lt;/a&gt;, the city is &lt;a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/pedestrian-program/sidewalk-development-program"&gt;slowly keeping that promise&lt;/a&gt;. The only problem: starting at around $500K+ per a single block, sidewalks are expensive. At the current rate of expenditure, it will take over 300 years for all of Seattle to have sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Home Zones and how do they aim to solve this problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Home Zone is an area that is protected from lots of fast moving traffic so that streets are safe enough to walk on. Home Zones keep local access for residents, emergency access, and deliveries while discouraging cut-through traffic. Home Zones can use a variety of street improvements to accomplish this but focus on improvements that have the best “bang for our buck” recognizing Seattle’s pedestrian budget is stretched very thin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Zones are meant to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it safe and comfortable for people of all ages and abilities to walk in a neighborhood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce cut-through traffic and speeding by keeping this traffic on the arterials (not increasing traffic on other neighborhood streets), while allowing neighbors to get to their homes, emergency access, deliveries, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance the quality of life for neighbors and strengthen our community (one way to do this is by integrating community art).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence: Home Zones aim to offer a drastically less expensive alternative to improve the walkability of currently unsidewalked streets, while also achieving a greater and more cohesive sense of community than can be made with sidewalks alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I donate to the effort?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle Neighborhood Greenways which is a local nonprofit working to make every neighborhood a great place to walk, bike, and live, is currently supporting this project with staff time and resources. You can donate to help make this a reality at &lt;a href="http://seattlegreenways.org/"&gt;seattlegreenways.org&lt;/a&gt;. Or contact &lt;a href="mailto:Gordon@seattlegreenways.org"&gt;Gordon@seattlegreenways.org&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens next? How can I get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in or near the pilot area or want to give input on the very first North Seattle home zone, you can find more information about the details of this project &lt;a href="https://lovelicton.com/pages/homezone"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Additionally, we encourage you to &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAtYcX8J4IQE_agDKW45oXHEvzt0LaOTQ1lImnO8CdkqSScg/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;amp;entry.1991292058=Yes"&gt;fill out the survey here&lt;/a&gt;
or email us at &lt;a href="mailto:meridianhomezone@gmail.com"&gt;meridianhomezone@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; to be kept up to date on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

Being able to easily walk between BevMo! and Total Wine in the same trip was a magical thing for anyone who anxiously awaited limited availability beer, wine, or spirit releases.
Of course, one-day several months ago, this duo came to an end, leaving only Total Wine - which sits at the bottom of an apartment complex, left in-tact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of the blog recently reached out to us, with an unsurprising explanation for that closure: BevMo!, which was nestled into an old-fashioned shopping strip, needed to close to make way for the expansion of Downtown Northgate. In the place of the old shopping plaza, plans are in place to build a 235 unit apartment building with retail at the bottom, continuing the trend happening around the old plaza:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old BevMo! Location" src="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alleyway showing grouping of mid-rises" src="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to give your input into the design of this new apartment building, there is an upcoming opportunity to contribute to the early design guidance &lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6936"&gt;August 6, 2018 6:30 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the redevelopment of the mall into the focal point of this new downtown area continues being planned, with the first two opportunities for community input coming tentatively next month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6930"&gt;August 13, 2018 6:30 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transit-oriented development, temporarily paused, has come back in full swing with a new RFP based on free land from King County and an upzone to allow up to 24 story buildings &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/king-county-moves-to-allow-affordable-housing-at-future-northgate-light-rail-station/"&gt;promised by the end of this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, concerns over future of the Northgate Pedestrian bridge which will connect Licton Springs directly to both the developing Light Rail and Downtown Northgate, have been alleviated after the &lt;a href="https://cascade.org/blog/2018/06/bridge-92-northgate-biking-and-walking-bridge-moving-forward"&gt;Seattle Colleges Board of Trustees conditionally agreed to give an easement to the new bridge&lt;/a&gt;.

And, with the light rail approaching in a few more years, it appears the community will be well positioned to take on the growth it desires. The neighbourhood has been seeing additional improvements planned and completed at an unprecedented pace. It's hard just to keep track of all the projects going on!

However, the best place to catch a glimpse of the local duck population in Seattle is right here in Licton Springs. Located on N 90th St between Densmore and Ashworth Ave N and near the new school: Pilling's Pond remains as a reminder of Chuck Pilling's legacy. This is the spot where he became the first successful breeder of the hooded merganser, bufflehead and harlequin ducks. Here you can still find hundreds of ducks enjoying the pond. While there has been some concern about the future of the pond due to a sale, the new owners have expressed their desire to keep the legacy going and have allowed Dave Kunkle to continue the maintenance of this great North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You can't enter the pond but can safely view the ducks from behind the wired fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will take 10-15 minutes to walk from the base of the bridge to the entrance of the transit center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge will incorporate scenic overlooks and art installation(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no bike/pedestrian or direction lane separation planned for the bridge. Instead, users will be expected to utilize the generously wide (16ft) path to follow standard right of way rules. Additionally, visual and tactile cues will be added near mixing areas, transition zones, and overlooks providing helpful cues to bicyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIA Architecture expressed pride in their work to create an affordable design that will still be an enjoyable experience to walk over, highlight the beauty inherit on both sides of I5, and act as another North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with Eric from VIA Architecture, I learned that they use VR to verify what a realistic experience of their designs will be once built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned about a ton of other exciting things planned for Licton Springs and the surrounding area that will be rolling out over the next few years. Expect a follow-up post with a full overview of all these changes and when we can expect them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Transportation"></category><category term="Pedestrian"></category></entry><entry><title>A new bridge is set to bring two Seattle neighbourhoods closer together</title><link href="/pedestrian-bridge-updates.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-14T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-03-14T07:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>timothycrosley</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-14:/pedestrian-bridge-updates.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Licton Springs is set to feel even more connected to Maple Leaf and the rest of the Northgate area.

With the construction of a pedestrian bridge on 100th, you will never have to walk more than 5 minutes North or South to cross over I5 and into Maple Leaf. This bridge is set to complement the existing Northgate Way underpass, 92nd overpass, and nearby 80th overpass directly connecting Licton Springs to the Northgate Transit Station and upcoming light rail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridge is proposed to be built at the north end of North Seattle College, giving it a straight path over to the transit center:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more about the plans for the new pedestrian bridge you can read &lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/bridges-stairs-and-other-structures/bridges/northgate-pedestrian-and-bicycle-bridge"&gt;Seattle's official overview of the project&lt;/a&gt;.
There are also 3 upcoming opportunities to give feedback on the project before construction begins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In related news, at the same time as the bridge will be under construction, it seems likely an improved Northgate Mall will also be underway to welcome us upon completion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears exciting times are ahead for Licton Springs and North Seattle!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Transportation"></category><category term="Pedestrian"></category></entry></feed>
