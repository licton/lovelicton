The project aims to connect Crown Hill, Greenwood, and Licton Springs both to each other and to the upcoming pedestrian bridge that will provide direct access to the Northgate light rail station. While the entire project, which will stretch around 2 miles, is a welcome addition - of particular interest to those in the Licton Springs area are a &lt;a href="https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/Greenways/N100thStFactsheet.pdf"&gt;new sidewalk from Linden Ave N to Aurora Ave N&lt;/a&gt; and sidewalk improvements being made between Aurora Ave N and Stone Ave N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="images/2018_greenway/banner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Linden currently without sidewalk" src="images/2018_greenway/banner.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="images/2018_greenway/linden_sidewalk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Linden sidewalk area" src="images/2018_greenway/linden_sidewalk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the work is complete, the hope is that it will be possible to safely walk or ride a bicycle all the way from Crown Hill to the new light rail station, with sidewalk at a  minimum from Linden Ave N eastward. You can find more information about the project on &lt;a href="https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/greenways-program/north-seattle"&gt;SDOT's overview page&lt;/a&gt;. The project should take around 6 months to complete with individual neighbors being directly contacted as construction work that impacts them is underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the traffic circle on Wallingford Ave N and N 97th &lt;a href="https://lovelicton.com/street_improvements_preview_2018.html"&gt;we wrote about earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; has now been completed and is just awaiting greenery.&lt;/p&gt;

The area in question has a moratorium on non-pedestrian oriented businesses, but the permit for the storage facility was placed right before it was put into effect. Beyond Aurora, the property is surrounded by homes and townhouses, and there is a strong desire by many within the area to increase housing and retail along Aurora, by lining it with apartment complexes that contain retail on the bottom. The thought being, that this would increase the safety of Aurora while helping to soften our current housing crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/golds_gym/location.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gold's Gym Location" src="/images/golds_gym/location.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="/images/golds_gym/houses_behind_gym.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Houses behind gym" src="/images/golds_gym/houses_behind_gym.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal comes as "Greenlake" Self-storage continues its construction just a few blocks south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/golds_gym/greenlake.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Greenlake Self-Storage" src="/images/golds_gym/greenlake.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing for the appeal is set for 9 AM on Monday, Aug. 13, at the City of Seattle Hearing Examiner’s Office, Seattle Municipal Tower, 700 5th Ave., 40th Floor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearings are open to the public, but generally only those who are parties to the appeal and persons called by the parties as witnesses will have the opportunity to testify. A person who has not appealed, but who has a substantial interest in the outcome of the appeal, may request to be allowed to participate in an appeal as an “intervenor”. An intervenor, like the parties, would have the option of appealing the Hearing Examiner’s decision in this matter. Intervenor status should be requested as soon as possible prior to hearing and in accordance with the Hearing Examiner Rules. For information regarding appeals and intervenor status, contact or visit the Hearing Examiner. The Hearing Examiner’s office provides barrier-free access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for the appeal reflects the concerns shared by many:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest is to maintain some sense of residential and environmental
neighborhood atmosphere. This project unfortunately has been grandfathered into the rezoning of
past. The current rezoning would not support this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Being able to easily walk between BevMo! and Total Wine in the same trip was a magical thing for anyone who anxiously awaited limited availability beer, wine, or spirit releases.
Of course, one-day several months ago, this duo came to an end, leaving only Total Wine - which sits at the bottom of an apartment complex, left in-tact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of the blog recently reached out to us, with an unsurprising explanation for that closure: BevMo!, which was nestled into an old-fashioned shopping strip, needed to close to make way for the expansion of Downtown Northgate. In the place of the old shopping plaza, plans are in place to build a 235 unit apartment building with retail at the bottom, continuing the trend happening around the old plaza:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old BevMo! Location" src="/images/downtown_northgate/bevmo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/crane.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Construction Around the Building" src="/images/downtown_northgate/crane.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alleyway showing grouping of mid-rises" src="/images/downtown_northgate/alley.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to give your input into the design of this new apartment building, there is an upcoming opportunity to contribute to the early design guidance &lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6936"&gt;August 6, 2018 6:30 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the redevelopment of the mall into the focal point of this new downtown area continues being planned, with the first two opportunities for community input coming tentatively next month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.seattle.gov/DPD/aboutus/news/events/DesignReview/Detail/default.aspx?id=6930"&gt;August 13, 2018 6:30 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transit-oriented development, temporarily paused, has come back in full swing with a new RFP based on free land from King County and an upzone to allow up to 24 story buildings &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/king-county-moves-to-allow-affordable-housing-at-future-northgate-light-rail-station/"&gt;promised by the end of this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, concerns over future of the Northgate Pedestrian bridge which will connect Licton Springs directly to both the developing Light Rail and Downtown Northgate, have been alleviated after the &lt;a href="https://cascade.org/blog/2018/06/bridge-92-northgate-biking-and-walking-bridge-moving-forward"&gt;Seattle Colleges Board of Trustees conditionally agreed to give an easement to the new bridge&lt;/a&gt;. The latest plans for which, will have the new bridge/path only a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/47.7015386,-122.3422173/47.7014736,-122.335324/@47.7008021,-122.3419329,16z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2"&gt;~5-10 minute walk away from Oak Tree Plaza&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/downtown_northgate/bridge.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="New Bridge" src="/images/downtown_northgate/bridge.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how you feel about the developments overall, hopefully, this all will lead to a North Seattle that feels more connected both to Downtown Seattle and to the neighborhoods contained within.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Transportation"></category><category term="Pedestrian"></category><category term="Construction"></category></entry><entry><title>Upcoming Events in Mineral Springs Park</title><link href="https://lovelicton.com/mineral-springs-events-july-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-08T01:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-07-08T01:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>amandacrosley</name></author><id>tag:lovelicton.com,2018-07-08:/mineral-springs-events-july-2018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you want to get involved in the Licton Springs community?

Licton Springs is no exception, and we are lucky to have at least &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; Teriyaki places within our &amp;lt; 1 square mile neighborhood.
With so many to choose from it can be difficult to know which one to try out. So, we decided to make the only logical decision and try all 4!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this taste test we decided to go with the plain Teriyaki Chicken dish from all 4 locations.
We took turns with a blindfold on while the other randomly gave us a taste of one of the Teriyaki dishes and asked for a score from 1-5.
We didn't include cost in our calculation since all 4 Teriyaki places had their Teriyaki priced within a few dimes of each other in the $8 range.
NOTE: Many of them also have lunch specials for around $7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The contenders&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/teriyaki/all.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The spread" src="/images/teriyaki/all.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href="/images/teriyaki/manna.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Manna Deli Teriyaki Store Front" src="/images/teriyaki/manna.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveniently located on Aurora and with very friendly service, this Teriyaki place currently enjoys the highest rating of the 3 Teriyaki only restaurants on Yelp, but unfortunately had the lowest health rating at the time we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the Oak Tree Plaza, right near the recently remodeled AMC (easily one of the comfiest theaters in Seattle now), this has long been my favorite Teriyaki place. The owner is super friendly,
they have these excellent house fries, and they have hours that work pretty well for eating before or after movies. However, I always get the Spicy Teriyaki here, so I'm curious to see how the regular Teriyaki fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only Teriyaki place of the 4 that neither of us had been to before, so we are both stoked to try it out for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address: 2100 N Northgate Way b, Seattle, WA 98133&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hours: 11AM-9PM Monday-Saturday, Closed Sunday&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucked away in a business complex on Meridian Ave, Cafe Banh Mi is the only place we tried that isn't marketed as a Teriyaki restaurant. It does, however, happen to have Teriyaki permanently on the menu. We discovered this when traveling back to Seattle on an early morning flight. We missed Seattle Teriyaki so much on our vacation - that we craved it upon returning. Cafe Banh Mi was the only place that served Teriyaki we could find that was also open at 8 AM. However, their matching early close time and non-existent weekend hours mean we don't get to enjoy this place nearly as often as we'd like to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a generous coating of Teriyaki glaze covering perfectly moist chicken, Cafe Banh Mi easily took the #1 spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amanda: 4.5 - "Delicious. I want more."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim: 4.5 - "By far the best."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;a href="/images/teriyaki/oaktree_teriyaki.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Oak Tree's Teriyaki" src="/images/teriyaki/oaktree_teriyaki.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    Oak Tree's distinctive crunch helped pull it into #2 place. And then there are those glorious house fries...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amanda: 3.75&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim 4.0 - "Has a really nice crunch to it."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/teriyaki/oaktree_fries.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Oak Tree's Fries" src="/images/teriyaki/oaktree_fries.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Bonus (House Fries):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amanda: 5.0 - "This isn't what we are taste testing, but these are delicious."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim: 10 - "That's right, these are off the scale. It's a good thing these aren't included in the actual rating."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community council has been the force behind improving Licton Springs and giving everyone in the community a voice for more than two decades.
This new website is part of a broader push to introduce the council to a whole new generation so that their great work can include a
broader audience and have even more impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also added in our menu a permanent link directly to the community council and from the community council's website a permanent link to the blog.
As part of this partnership &lt;a href="https://lovelicton.com"&gt;lovelicton.com&lt;/a&gt; will continue to be the place to go to get a pulse on the community and read about the positive changes going on
and &lt;a href="https://lictonsprings.org"&gt;lictonsprings.org&lt;/a&gt; will be the place to join your neighbors and &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; more of those positive changes happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder: the Licton Springs Community Council will have a booth at the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1999117153465269/"&gt;Live in D5!&lt;/a&gt; event that is happening &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt; 1-4PM at Hubbart Homestead Park.
It's a great opportunity to get introduced to the council as well as many other nearby community groups - while enjoying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 local bands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free salmon and fry bread sponsored by the United Indians of All Tribes&lt;/li&gt;

This next Tuesday (the 19th, a week and some change from now) at 6:30 PM we will be holding our first beginner's disc golf game, with help from members of the local disc golf community. At this event, you will not only be able to learn how to play alongside other beginners but will also be able to receive valuable tips from some more veteran disc golf players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/course.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Course Map" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/course.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event will be held at Mineral Springs park, located on the north end of Licton Springs. This course takes the honor of being the original and only Disc Golf course in Seattle proper. Being a city course it also has a more compact intricate design making it uniquely well suited to learning disc golf technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/hole_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hole 6" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/hole_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having never Disc Golfed ourselves, my wife and I went by the course this morning to get some sense of the game. In the course, we were struck by not only the beauty and tranquillity of a course nestled in the city but also by the friendliness of disc golfers. We ran into Mary and Tony who took us through both some of the basics of Disc Golf and the unique traits of this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/mary_and_tony.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mary and Tony" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/mary_and_tony.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are poles throughout the course used to hold up netting that separates pathways and different sections of the course.
They told us that every time your disc hits one of those poles and makes a little ringing sound, it's called North Park Love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/mineral_springs/disc/poles.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="North park love" src="/images/mineral_springs/disc/poles.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to enjoy the summer weather, learn how to Disc Golf, and ring in some North Park Love with some of you there!&lt;/p&gt;

Regardless what your thoughts are on the overall legislation, I encourage you to let our council members know what we as a community want from Aurora. For me that means more gems like the wonderful neighborhood shops that fill Oak Tree Plaza and fewer storage facilities. Either way, as the final public hearing happens tomorrow (June 5th) this may be your last opportunity to let the council know how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From our friends at &lt;a href="http://auroralictonuv.org/"&gt;ALUV&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear ALUV Friends and Neighbors, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for continued interest in bringing positive change to the Aurora Ave Corridor, specifically from N. 84th to N. 110th. As we continue our efforts to increase public safety via “eyes on the street” our biggest obstacle is the commercial zoning designation. This zoning has recently allowed for two public storage facilities to be built that provide no housing or walkable amenities to our Residential Urban Village as designated by the city in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please email your support for the proposed zoning changes from Commercial (C) to Neighborhood Commercial (NC) to the Seattle City Council &lt;a href="mailto: council@seattle.gov"&gt;council@seattle.gov&lt;/a&gt; prior to JUNE 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

This brave crew cleans up everything from coffee cups to used syringes, hopefully helping to encourage a sustainably clean street over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, SPD and Licton Spring's own North Precinct have been hard at work to bust a local pawn shop that incentivised theft within North Seattle. Along with the closure of the business, this had the side effect of finally permanently removing an Aurora fixture that we will all be happy to see go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/SR99/RoySt145thPaving/default.htm"&gt;Aurora is going to be repaved and sidewalk ramps made ADA compliant over the next year&lt;/a&gt;. Which, while sure to be an inconvenience during construction and &lt;a href="http://kuow.org/post/state-repaving-aurora-thats-chance-build-sidewalks-no"&gt;lacking the sidewalk improvements Aurora desperately needs&lt;/a&gt;, will hopefully be worth it upon completion as it plays a part in increasing road safety and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more work is needed along this historic stretch of Seattle, it's encouraging that we are starting to see progress toward an Aurora that we can all take pride in.&lt;/p&gt;

neighborhood, though he lives in quiet obscurity, not troubled by his You-Tube fame. He plays the role
of a depressed, French cat in a series of videos that have garnered millions of viewers. Henry has over
170,000 Facebook followers and has been featured on Animal Planet and in People magazine. Henry also
has two books out on his philosophy and a Wikipedia page. But no French Riviera for this feline! “I love

The circle will be a very welcome addition to the area, as, despite lots of warning signs and kids, sees more than its fair share of speeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new circle will complement the existing one at N 95th, hopefully reducing speed driving up Wallingford.&lt;/p&gt;

The art not only serves as a sign of nicer weather, as flowers bloom from Tesla's head but also serves as a great reminder that technology and
nature can coexist in harmony. In a way, it's the perfect Seattle art piece, a city nestled in some of the most profoundly beautiful natural
environments while leading the way in our technological future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rushing to the restaurant after work, I was greeted not by Tropicos Breeze, but by El Patio. What a quick transformation! Entering El Patio, I saw familiar faces and after talking to the staff learned what had taken place. The Licton Spring's Tropicos Breeze location was sold to the owner's cousin. The new restaurant, I was told, retains the same staff and great quality food we have come to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered Pollo en Crema and Horchata - two of my favorite standbys from the old Tropicos Breeze. You know, just to make sure I was told the truth...
And I can happily confirm: the food here is as tasty as ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is a P-Patch?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P-Patch is the name given to community gardens that are managed by the Seattle P-Patch Community Gardening Program. The P-Patch program oversees 88 P-Patches over 32 acres throughout the city. Though a P-Patch, neighbors can come together to plan, plant, and grow community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is the history of Licton Spring's P-Patch?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Licton Springs P-Patch dates back to 1976 as a student-driven initiative at North Seattle College. While the original community garden ended up as a school parking lot, in 2013 the North Seattle College Sustainability Committee revived the initiative. After over a year of hard work from the community digging up land, building plots, and adding compost, a community garden of 67 plots and 15,000 sq ft was developed in Licton Springs! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How can I get involved?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For information about volunteering, events, and general p-patch activities, email &lt;a href="mailto:lictonspringsppatch@gmail.com"&gt;lictonspringsppatch@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; or visit the community website at &lt;a href="http://www.lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle"&gt;www.lictonspringsppatch.wixsite.com/seattle&lt;/a&gt;. The next community work party will be on Sunday, 4/15 from 11am to 1pm at the garden. The next leadership meeting will be on the first Wednesday of May (5/2) at 6pm at the OCEE building room 229 on North Seattle College campus. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"></category><category term="Outdoors"></category><category term="Parks"></category><category term="Gardening"></category></entry><entry><title>Want to be involved in the Licton Springs Community?</title><link href="https://lovelicton.com/new-community-calendar-and-resource.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-08T16:57:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-08T16:57:00-07:00</updated><author><name>timothycrosley</name></author><id>tag:lovelicton.com,2018-04-08:/new-community-calendar-and-resource.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Want to stay up to date on all the community events and meetings going on in Licton Springs and surrounding areas?

It already has relatively high side-walk coverage and population density for the North Seattle area. It is also full of pro-growth and housing community groups - with no noticeable Nimby presence. And, with the light rail approaching in a few more years, it appears the community will be well positioned to take on the growth it desires. The neighbourhood has been seeing additional improvements planned and completed at an unprecedented pace. It's hard just to keep track of all the projects going on! To try and make it a bit easier: I've gone ahead and taken inventory of all the projects I'm aware of and mapped them out by location, start time, and end time.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the best place to catch a glimpse of the local duck population in Seattle is right here in Licton Springs. Located on N 90th St between Densmore and Ashworth Ave N and near the new school: Pilling's Pond remains as a reminder of Chuck Pilling's legacy. This is the spot where he became the first successful breeder of the hooded merganser, bufflehead and harlequin ducks. Here you can still find hundreds of ducks enjoying the pond. While there has been some concern about the future of the pond due to a sale, the new owners have expressed their desire to keep the legacy going and have allowed Dave Kunkle to continue the maintenance of this great North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You can't enter the pond but can safely view the ducks from behind the wired fence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college has expressed approval with the new design alleviating concerns that disagreements would lead to no bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new design decreases costs and the maximum slope while improving visibility and addressing the concerns of North Seattle College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project has secured all necessary funding contingent on it being complete before the light rail opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take 10-15 minutes to walk from the base of the bridge to the entrance of the transit center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge will incorporate scenic overlooks and art installation(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no bike/pedestrian or direction lane separation planned for the bridge. Instead, users will be expected to utilize the generously wide (16ft) path to follow standard right of way rules. Additionally, visual and tactile cues will be added near mixing areas, transition zones, and overlooks providing helpful cues to bicyclists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VIA Architecture expressed pride in their work to create an affordable design that will still be an enjoyable experience to walk over, highlight the beauty inherit on both sides of I5, and act as another North Seattle landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with Eric from VIA Architecture, I learned that they use VR to verify what a realistic experience of their designs will be once built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned about a ton of other exciting things planned for Licton Springs and the surrounding area that will be rolling out over the next few years.

&lt;p&gt;The bridge is proposed to be built at the north end of North Seattle College, giving it a straight path over to the transit center:&lt;/p&gt;
