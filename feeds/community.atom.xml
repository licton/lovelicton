All of the major candidates running for the District 5 council seat have gone on record in support. The momentum is building, and your voice could help make the community center a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the recent Celebrate North Seattle event at Oaktree plaza, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AuroraLicton/"&gt;ALUV (Aurora-Licton Springs Urban Village)&lt;/a&gt; asked over 120 people what was most important to them about having a community center. The top 10 answers were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ibrary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large gathering space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sport Court&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Childcare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior Activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After school programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fitness classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting Rooms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
