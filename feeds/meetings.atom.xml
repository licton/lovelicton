A tiny house village opened on the street 2 years ago, while reports indicated that crime was concentrating in the area.
Then, after months of escalating tensions, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/prosecutors-suspect-became-fixated-on-homeless-man-before-fatal-seattle-shooting/"&gt;a homeless man was shot and killed on Nesbit&lt;/a&gt;. While all of this was occurring, a large seemingly abandoned lot, and 2 large construction projects left few eyes on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/nesbit/tiny_houses.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tiny Houses" src="/images/nesbit/tiny_houses.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/nesbit/abandoned.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Abandoned" src="/images/nesbit/abandoned.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/nesbit/construction_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="construction" src="/images/nesbit/construction_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led &lt;a href="https://www.sngi.org/welcome/index.php"&gt;Seattle Neighborhood Group&lt;/a&gt; to create a Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByAPPfoZcdyXRTJIb0hhMUF4aWpQN2VVMUpIb24wblpKeHR3/view?usp=sharing"&gt;(CPTED) report&lt;/a&gt; on the 8800th block of Nesbit at the end of 2017, and then survey neighbors about the area last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the tiny house village has announced its permanent closure, to be replaced with a 112 unit affordable housing project built by &lt;a href="https://lihi.org/"&gt;LIHI&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/nesbit/tiny_house_replacement.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tiny House Replacement" src="/images/nesbit/tiny_house_replacement.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the street, branches have been trimmed, new lights installed to improve visibility, and sharps containers planned. And of course, construction projects are getting closer to completion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/nesbit/new_lights.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="new_lights" src="/images/nesbit/new_lights.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/nesbit/88th.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="88th construction" src="/images/nesbit/88th.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle Neighborhood Group wants to keep this momentum going, and is hosting a community meeting to discuss the survey and improvements this Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/nesbit/flyer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nesbit Meeting" src="/images/nesbit/flyer.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will be held at the nearby Cascadia Elementary School, January 17th, 6-7:30 PM.
Hopefully, as neighbors, we can impact the future of Nesbit together.&lt;/p&gt;
